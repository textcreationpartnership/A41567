            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE <hi>Chriſtian READER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ALL Prayers and Endeavours against the Abominations of the Times, have not altogether been in vain, a kind of Curb having by the late Act been put upon it; and if the Offenders be ſtrictly puniſh'd, through God's Bleſſing we may hope to ſee the Sins really ſuppreſſed; the Law, if not well kept, is but a dead Letter, and becomes contemptible, but a ſtrict Execution makes it uſeful and effectual, which we promiſe our ſelves to ſee, by the Pious Care of a Prince, whoſe Chief and most Glorious Title is, <hi>Defender of the True Chriſtian Faith;</hi> whilst Violent and Cruel Perſecutions are raging abroad, and ſad Anti-chriſtian Impieties at home, <hi>who knoweth whether he be come to the Kingdom for ſuch a Time as this,</hi> to be an Eminent Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in God's Hands, to do that Work?</p>
            <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:30142:3"/>
            <p>God in an extraordinary manner hath raiſed him upon the Throne of theſe Three Kingdoms, and as he doth nothing in vain, ſo we may well conceive it to be for ſome extraordinary Ends. Therefore I now upon my Knees do most humbly beſeech Him, <hi>by whom Kings Reign,</hi> in a plentiful meaſure to give the King the Spirit of Wiſdom, Knowledge, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and of the Fear of his Name; that he may truly know what God, after the great things he hath done for him, doth now expect from him, and to guide, direct, and with his helping Hand ſupport Him in bringing thoſe Great Ends about.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>HIS MAJESTY</hi> hath given us Peace with Men, and we now humbly deſire he would endeavour to procure it with God, and cauſe the War we are at against Heaven, to ceaſe; which we cannot ſo much as hope for, as long as God's Great Name is Prophaned, his Son Diſhonoured, his Holy Spirit Blaſphemed, his Word wreſted and Impiouſly ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed by a ſort of Men in the World, who not only in private, but openly with Tongue and Pen go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to pull our Holy Religion up by the very Root, and to overthrow the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity; who not only proudly deſpiſe the Judgment of the whole Primitive Church, but that which is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſe, through their Impieties and Blaſphemies, they Crucifie again the Lord of Glory, make the Wounds of Christ to bleed afreſh; and who, to ſpeak in the Apoſtle's Words, <hi>Have trodden under Foot the Son of God, and counted the Blood of the Covenant wherewith we are Sanctified,
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:30142:3"/>an Unholy thing, and have done Deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace:</hi> That Holy Blood which at other times ſpeaks better things than that of <hi>Abel</hi>'s, doth now upon this Occaſion cry loud for Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, becauſe 'tis abominably prophaned, and by the denial of the Cauſes and Effects of its being ſhed, undervalued.</p>
            <p>We thank God for the Proſpect we have to ſee the Evil remedied through <hi>His Majeſty's</hi> wholſome Influences: The Life of our Laws, without which they are inſignificant, we hope to ſee derived from him; and, if I may be allowed to make a Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in a thing which admits of none, as <hi>the Spirit of God moved upon the Face of the Waters,</hi> to quicken and make them fruitful, ſo the Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from the Throne, and the Motions of the Royal Authority, can infuſe an effective Vertue into our Acts of Parliament: For, as of a Bill to make a Law, the King's Aſſent is neceſſary, without which 'tis but a dead Lump without Form, and ſignifies nothing; ſo when 'tis paſſed, the Executive Power, Originally in the King, is that which gives it Life and Strength, or elſe 'tis dormant and languiſheth. Now upon the preſent Account, far be it from us to think that for want of commanding a due execution of the Laws, <hi>His Majeſty</hi> will ever ſuffer Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, Idolatry, Prophaneneſs, and Immorality to be Blots and Stains in his Reign.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Majeſty's</hi> Word we have for, and may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon't; inſomuch that in caſe the Act doth not produce it's due Effect, as conſidering the Spirit of that Odious Sect, ſome are of Opinion it will not,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:30142:4"/>no doubt but that <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> without being prompted to't, will of himſelf be pleaſed to mind the Honour of God, and of Religion. The Ground of our Hope and Confidence is this: At the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the last Seſſion of Parliament, the King in his Speech to both Houſes, promiſed to take care to ſuppreſs Prophaneneſs and Immorality; which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded <hi>the Honourable Houſe of Commons</hi> an Occaſion to Addreſs to <hi>His Majeſty</hi> concerning it; and <hi>His Majeſty's</hi> Anſwer when 'twas preſented, deſerves to be written in Letters of Gold: Thus it was—<hi>Gentlemen, I cannot but be very well pleaſed with an Addreſs of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and will give immediately Directions in the ſeveral Particulars you deſire: But I could wiſh ſome more effectual Proviſion were made for the ſuppreſſing thoſe pernicious Books and Pamphlets your Addreſs takes notice of.</hi> The Work of Reformation is great, but the time ſhort, ſo it's neceſſary to begin it betimes, and follow it cloſe.</p>
            <p>No Man, as our Saviour ſaith, having put his Hand to the Plough, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God: Therefore no one that in his Station hath concern'd himſelf in this good and just Cauſe, must draw back, but within the Sphere of his Activity, must go on to promote it, and not be weary in well doing: Before Men engage in a Matter, they ought to know why, and upon what Grounds? But once being ſatisfy'd with its Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Goodneſs, notwithſtanding Difficulties and Oppoſitions, they are bound to continue for, and not forſake it; for God in his due time will bring all to
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:30142:4"/>a happy end: Men either must not believe, or elſe must own what they believe, and profeſs what they own: He that comes with God's Word in his Mouth, needs not be aſhamed or afraid: For my part with the Royal Prophet I may ſay, <hi>I will ſpeak of thy Teſtimonies alſo before Kings, and will not be aſhamed.</hi>

            <head>THE True Character OF THE <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> OF SOCINIANISM.</head>
            <p>SOme Men in the World, without any ground but their own Fancy, preſume to make Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks for themſelves, and Mock-Apologies for Parliaments: But if ſuch have (not to ſay worſe) the Confidence, which only that kind are capable of, to give their Pamphlets the Titles of <hi>An Apology for the Parliament, humbly repreſenting,</hi> &amp;c. I think I might upon better grounds now be allowed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe few Sheets, to prefix the Name of a <hi>Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick for the Parliament,</hi> by reaſon of what that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and Noble Aſſembly have lately done for the Cauſe of God in general, the Intereſt of his Son in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and for the Good of his Church: But as I know ſuch returns to be below their Merits and Deſires, and far above my Skill to do't well, as 'twas not fit for every Artiſt, only for <hi>Apelles,</hi> to draw <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Picture; ſo I leave it for them who will venture upon ſo Noble and hard a Task: For as I have a ſingular Veneration for the Name of a Parliament, for fear of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30142:6"/>undervaluing it with not anſwering the Dignity of the Subject, I ſhall content my ſelf with mentioning the Piety of thoſe worthy Perſons, who, having adopted that Cauſe, have notwithſtanding all Difficulties, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, and both direct and indirect Oppoſitions, with ſo much Zeal, Care and Diligence carry'd it on, and been inſtrumental in the Succeſs, for which they juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Thanks of the whole Chriſtian Church, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of that part which is within this Kingdom: But that which is moſt of all, the great and gracious God, whom no Man ever ſerv'd in vain, will according to his Truth and Promiſe, (as I moſt humbly beſeech him to do't), plentifully reward them for the good Service, which, according to their Power, they have done him: And as in this World there is nothing ſo good, but it may admit of ſome Additional Degrees of Perfection, ſo we hope, hereafter, God, who, when he will, can eaſily incline the Hearts, and over-rule the Counſels of Men, will be pleaſed further to make uſe of them as happy Inſtruments in his hands, to work a thorough Reformation both in Doctrines and Practices. In the mean while, we muſt not be like thoſe who are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and greedy after what they deſire and have not, that they are unmindful to give God thanks for what they enjoy: But ſeeing, through his Mercy, there is a ſtep towards putting a Curb and Reſtraint upon Chriſt's Enemies, ſo that we hope, if a due Care be taken to execute what hath been Enacted, and prevent every way the increaſe of Fuel both at home and from abroad; Blaſphemy, Impiety, Prophaneneſs, and Immorality ſhall be compell'd to ſtop their mouth, and hide their face: Therefore, for what we have for the preſent, and hope for the future, let us join our Voices in that Heavenly Conſort of Angels upon the Account of our Saviour's Birth, which the laſt <hi>Act</hi> ought to renew the Memory of,<note place="margin">Luk. 2.14.</note>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30142:6"/>and upon all occaſions there is between thoſe two Extremes a Conflict, till God turns the Scales, which he never fails to do, but will have us to wait for it, and not be weary in well doing; we muſt never be ſo preſumptuous, as to go about prefixing God a time, or preſcribing him Ways and Means, or attempt to put him out of the Courſe of his wiſe Providence, becauſe he doth ſo to try the Faith, and exerciſe the Patience of his People, as he did formerly, by ſending falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets among them, and thus to make them depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; yet in the mean time, he will have them to uſe Means, and to omit nothing that may contribute to bring to a happy end thoſe things which belong to his Service, which we ought to ſtick to, and upon any account what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, not to ſuffer our ſelves to be moved therefrom; one Beam of God's Favour, is infinitely to be minded more than all the Smiles and Frowns of the World.</p>
            <p>Let not Chriſt's Adverſaries ſay, that what is done againſt them is by Power; for though it be by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſtill 'tis according to Juſtice, there have been Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Arguments enough, which yet remain unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, offered, if they had been diſpos'd to receive them; that Great God, whoſe Perſon and Grace they deſpiſe, and whoſe Patience they tired out, hath begun to make uſe of that Humane Authority under him, which they would have excluded from meddling with them about Matters of Religion, in ſome degree to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his Honour, and aſſert his Truth. In what follows, I hope abundantly to make the Parliament's Panegyrick, when I have ſhewed what a horrid, and upon many accounts, abominable Monſter of complicated Hereſies they fought againſt and wounded: And herein I muſt before-hand prepare the pious Reader to ſee ſuch things as will ſtrike him with Horrour, I am ſure, it hath in many places made my hair ſtand on end; all drawn out of their own Writings; and tho' I ſhall avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long in Quotations, for as to that, I could ſay much more than I do, yet I ſhall, by the Grace of God, ſay enough to make good upon them the Charge of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy in the higheſt degree, and nothing in't but what I do or can prove, and leave it to be judg'd of by the Reader; and withal I ſolemnly declare, as in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, that I do not write out of any Self-end,

If ſo, then it was from Eternity, for in Scripture to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World, and to be from Eternity, are Synoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and ſignifie the ſame, and this is to joyn in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with thoſe who hold the World to have been E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, which is <hi>a parte ante</hi> to match God's Eternity, and alſo to make it Eternal <hi>a parte poſt.</hi> This alſo ſtrikes at his Almightineſs, as if he could not have made ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of nothing, which properly is Creation.</p>

            <p>Scripture we Chriſtians call the Infallible Rule of Faith and Practice: Now in Obedience and Regard to God, and according unto ſound Reaſon, to the directive and deciſive Authority of this Rule, we who are ſo fallible ought to ſubmit our Judgments to, and yield Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Faith: 'Tis very unreaſonable to make every one's Reaſon a Judge in Matters of Religion, thus there ſhall be ſo many Men, ſo many Judges: yet in the World are ſo many ignorant unlearned, carnal, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd with Prejudices, blind, wordly, obſtinate, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deprived of the Spirit of God; here is a great Number and Diverſity of Judges, but how can they be Judges of things which they do not underſtand? about theſe Matters another Errour of theirs is, That they would not have the Doctrines of Faith to be drawn by Conſequences out of Scripture; for, ſay they, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Reaſon which all are not capable of; therefore ſay I, we do not allow every one to draw thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences: Neither is their Argument good, becauſe, though Reaſon be neceſſary to Knowledge, yet 'tis not as if it were the Foundation, but as 'tis the Inſtrument

Now I ſay, that a Concluſion well deduced from premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is alſo true, becauſe virtually contained in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and 'tis moſt certain that in the Word ſeveral great Truths are proved by deduced Conſequences, as is one of the Fundamental Articles of our Faith,<note place="margin">Matth. 22.31, 32.

               <hi>I will Glory in my Inſirmities that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me,</hi> ſo that the Divinity and Invocation of our Bleſſed Saviour is clear enough out of Scripture, ſo 'tis out of the Faith and Practice of the Chriſtian Church at all times. That by the Primitive Chriſtians he was believed to be true Conſubſtantial God and adored as ſuch, it appears not only out of the Writings of the Doctors of the Church, both before and after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, who Condemn'd as Hereticks all that did ſpeak or writ againſt it, but alſo by the Teſtimony of their Heathen Enemies as <hi>Pliny</hi> in what he did write to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Trajan</hi> about the Chriſtians, who gave of them this Character, that they owned Chriſt to be God, and as ſuch, Sung hymns in his Praiſe.</p>

            <p>Now we muſt go on and ſpeak of other things: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Adam,</hi> they hold many bad and dangerous Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours: as Scripture ſaith,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.27.</note> 
               <hi>he was Created in God's own Image,</hi> which conſiſted not in one but in many things, in Soul and Body, and in the Union of both in his Perſon: the <hi>Soul</hi> is in the Image of God, <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to her <hi>Nature</hi> which is Spiritual and Immortal, <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the Faculties, namely the Underſtanding and Will, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the habits of thoſe Faculties, that is in Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, for as God is Spiritual and Immortal, ſo is the Soul; as to Underſtand and to Will are Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of God, ſo he endued Man's Soul with an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and a Will, as to the <hi>Body,</hi> though there be leſs of God's Image in it than in the Soul, becauſe God is a Spirit without Body, yet ſome Conformity there is, for it affords ſome Organs which are ſubſervient to the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Soul, and ſo the Body is in its manner an Image of Divine Perfection, it doth hear and ſee and is a Symbol and Inſtrument of the Perfections of the Soul, and of the Maker, for the Wiſdom, Power and other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God are commonly repreſented by the Members as the Eyes, Ears, Mouth and Hands of the Body. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Image of God did conſiſt in the whole Perſon in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the dominion which God gave <hi>Adam</hi> over all other Worldly Creatures, alſo as to Happineſs, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, for as God is Lord over the whole Work of Creation and Enjoys a Supreme Felicity, ſo he conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him Lord of other Creatures and placed him in a State of happy Immortality.</p>
            <p>But ſeveral of theſe they deny or have corrupted: they would not have God's Image to have conſiſted in Immortality and Righteouſneſs, for they, affirm <hi>Adam</hi> to have been created Mortal, and that he had died though he had not ſinn'd; but if ſo, then God's Threatning his Diſobedience with Death, had been in vain and to no purpoſe; if he had died whether or not he had ſinned, then Death had been no Puniſhment for his Sin, yet the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.23. Chap. 5.12.</note> 
               <hi>the Wages of Sin is Death,</hi> he ſaid before, <hi>By one Man Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin.</hi> Though his Body was made of a frail matter, yet thorough God's Gift it might have been Immortal as it ſhall be after the Reſurrection; that Immortality of our firſt Parents we call a power and faculty of not dying,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30142:15"/>which to them was Natural, for if they had continued in their integrity, they had not died, and in that State 'twas as Natural not to die as not to Sin; Death neceſſarily follows Sin, and no Sin no Death: as to that holineſs and Righteouſneſs wherein chiefly conſiſted the Image of God in which they were created, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of it when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Epeſ. 4.24.</note> 
               <hi>that ye put on the new Man which after God is created in Righteouſneſs and true holineſs,</hi> which in the verſe before he called to <hi>be renewed in the Spirit of your mind,</hi> which implies that once in us there was ſuch a thing, but was ſince decay'd and loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> we had and loſt it in him, but in Chriſt were reſtored thereunto: but <hi>Socinians</hi> who pretend to a right of making all things to be as they would, laugh at it, <hi>primum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to affirm,</hi> ſaith one,<note n="*" place="margin">Smalc. exam.

Chap. 1.31. Chap. 2.17. V. 20.</note> when we read they were a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their Sin, this in them imports a reflection upon God their Maker, and 'tis to give Scripture the lie, when it ſaith, <hi>and God ſaw, that every thing he had made was very good;</hi> and alſo when God ſaid to <hi>Adam, in the day that thou Eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely Die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſay farther, that he had not the excellent and certain Knowledge of the Creator, nor of the reſt of the Creatures, which if true, then he had been an imperfect Work of God; but ſeeing God, who was a competent Judge of the thing, left it for him to <hi>give names to all Cattel, and to the Fowl of the Air, and to every Beaſt of the field,</hi> which God approved of, we muſt believe he had that certain Knowledge,<note n="†" place="margin">Se ſtatu prim. hom. c. <hi>6.</hi> v. <hi>23.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now when I am upon this point about Knowledge, I ſhall paſs to another which they oppoſe; 'tis this, That there is a Natural Knowledge of God, whereby we mean that Men who have the uſe of Natural Reaſon, may without ſpecial Revelation, by the conſideration of God's Works in the World, know that there is a God, a firſt Cauſe of all, who hath his being of himſelf, and hath given all things theirs; but they being uſed to gainſay Scripture, affirm, that by the light of nature Men cannot know that there is a God, though <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30142:16"/>may be known of God is manifeſt in Men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.19, 20, 21, 28.</note> 
               <hi>for God hath ſhewed it unto them;</hi> and it may more appear in the Verſes quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Margin, and this knowledge is ſuch as to leave them <hi>without excuſe,</hi> and this carries them ſo far, as that <hi>by nature they do the things contain'd in the law, which ſhew the work of the law written in their hearts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 2.14. 15.</note> 
               <hi>their Conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one another:</hi> an evil Conſcience attended with terrours for fear of puniſhment, and a good one with joy, do demonſtrate there is a God revenger for evil, and rewarder of good: but what's that to them, let Scripture ſpeak never ſo poſitively and plainly, things muſt be as they will have them to be.</p>
            <p>The next thing is about <hi>Original</hi> Sin, that is, the ſtain and corruption which we bring into the World, and as it is in humane nature: 'tis ſo call'd becauſe it hath it's ſpring and origine from <hi>Adam,</hi> and alſo becauſe 'tis origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and naturally from the Womb in every Man, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Child; it conſiſts in the privation of that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal righteouſneſs wherein the firſt Man was created, and in the corruption inherent in our nature, whereby we are averſe from good and inclined to evil, which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> who are a line of the <hi>generation</hi> ſpoken of,<note place="margin">Prov. 30.12.

God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threatnings, were not confin'd in him, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to his whole Poſterity, which would have enjoyed the benefit of his Obedience, if he had continued in his integrity, as they have ſmarted for his Diſobedience: as 'tis uſual among Men to ſee, the Blood and Family of Traytors to ſuffer for the Crimes of Parents, and thereby to forfeit Eſtates and Dignities: this imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30142:16"/>Sin, is by the Apoſtle plainly and fully proved,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. from v. 12. to the end of the Chapter. Pſal. 145.17. 2 Sam. 24.

            </p>
            <p>The other part of this Sin is the <hi>inherency,</hi> or hereditary corruption, thorough the Fall of our firſt Parents, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally propagated in us, whereby we become guilty and filthy, having in us the Seed and Spawn of all Sins, whereby we deſerve temporal and eternal puniſhments: as at firſt the Perſon infected the nature, ſo hath ever ſince the nature infected every Perſon; thus Experience ſhews how the Plague, Leproſy, and other contagious diſeaſes, do by Communication corrupt the Conſtitution of the whole Body, as a poiſon'd Arrow, Sword, or Bullet, will, and how eaſily are diſeaſes in the Blood, by Parents propagated to Children, thus we ſee certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers and Vices inherent in ſome Families, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this Reaſon and experience, Scripture the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge of it ſaith ſo, <hi>for who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not One,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Job 14.4.

            <p>As to matters of Grace, though Scripture takes away from Man all Power and Diſpoſition by <hi>Nature</hi> to do Good and what is acceptable to God, yet in that State, wherein he is but a ſlave of Satan, ſold under Sin, who cannot ceaſe from Sin, they allo a free-will and power to fullfil the Law, for they ſay, <hi>though</hi>

            <p>The Orthodox Doctrines about the Sacraments, Faith, Juſtification, and in ſew words, every Article of our Holy Religion, they more or leſs do depravate; thus they ſet up a new one of their own making, as it hath plainly been demonſtrated by ſeveral Proteſtant Divines. They ſet up two ways of Salvation, one under the Old Teſtament, the other under the New: We own there are ſeveral ways to Hell, yet there is but one, and that ſtrait too,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.20.</note> leading to Heaven, which is <hi>the new and living way, which he</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>hath conſecrated for us thorough the Vail, that is to ſay, his Fleſh.</hi> This in Subſtance, though under different Circumſtances, was for his People under the Old, as 'tis under the New Teſtament: The whole Church of God, though conſiſting of Jews and Gentiles, is but one Church, ſo there is but one Head, Lord and Saviour, and ſo but one way to Salvation: Now that Church (God) Chriſt hath purchaſed with his own Blood, that is by the Merits of his Death:<note place="margin">Rom. 3.25.</note> 
               <hi>God hath ſet forth</hi> the Meſſiah <hi>Jeſus Chriſt to be a propitiation thorough Faith
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30142:22"/>in his Blood,</hi> for his People, under the Old, as under the New Teſtament, and <hi>we are juſtified by his Blood:</hi>

               <note place="margin">Acts 4.12.</note> or already come with <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> for the Apoſtle's words are full, plain, and general; <hi>neither is there Salvation in any other, for there is no other name under Heaven given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, whereby we muſt be ſaved:</hi> Yet this clear truth they will not yield to, for ſaith<note n="*" place="margin">Smalc. cont. frantz. diſp. <hi>4.</hi> theſ. <hi>8.</hi>
               </note> one of them, <hi>what</hi> Frantzius <hi>Writes, that the Ancients believed in Jeſus to come, and thorough that Faith were juſtified, ought to be reckon'd among the groſſeſt errours.—Juſtification by Faith was never profered to Men before the coming of Chriſt, neither was it promiſed that Man ſhould be juſtified by Faith;</hi> yet <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtify'd by Faith,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.6.</note> for <hi>Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteouſneſs,</hi> wherein did he believe God? Not only in the promiſe that his Poſterity ſhould be very numerous, but alſo chiefly at the promiſe that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come out of his Seed,<note place="margin">Gen. 12.3.</note> 
               <hi>and in thee ſhall all the Families of the Earth be Bleſſed,</hi> which was a renewing of the Promiſe made to our firſt Parents of the <hi>Woman</hi>'s Seed, which then God fixed in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family; now this Seed of his in whom all the Families of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed, is what <hi>Abraham</hi> believed, and that Faith of his concerning it, was to him accounted for Righteouſneſs, and there is no doubt to be made, but that God who ſo familiarly converſed with him as with a <hi>Friend;</hi> for ſo Scripture calls him,<note place="margin">Iſai. 41.8.</note> in a ſpecial manner revealed to him the Myſtery of his coming in the Fleſh, for it was the Son of God, the ſecond Perſon of the moſt holy Trinity, who at ſeveral times under the name of an Angel, and in the ſhape of a Man appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> who, as our Lord ſaith, rejoyced to ſee his day with the Eye of Faith, that day or time when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Fleſh, which <hi>Abraham</hi> who lived ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did ſee, not as actually preſent, but as to come; and that Faith whereby <hi>Abraham</hi> believed in a Saviour to come, he was juſtify'd by, and as he is called the Father of all
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:30142:23"/>them that believe, ſo all believers muſt have the ſame Faith which he had;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.5.</note> for there is but <hi>one Faith,</hi> and <hi>one Lord,</hi> which imports one and the ſame object of that Faith only with this difference upon the account of time, that <hi>Abraham</hi> believed in him that was to come, and we in him who is already come. Now to the later part of what <hi>Smalcius</hi> ſaith, that there is no promiſe that Man ſhould be juſtified by Faith; I ſay if it be not by Faith, it muſt be by Works, for there is no middle, but ſeeing St. <hi>Paul</hi> in ſeveral places of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> doth ſo poſitively exclude Works, not only thoſe of the Law, but alſo thoſe call'd Evangelical; with the ſame Apoſtle we muſt conclude <hi>Man to be juſtified by Faith without Works:</hi> but they are thorough paced,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.28.</note> for <hi>regeneration and other good works, Love, Invocation, Obedience, Hope, Charity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>far from being the effects of Juſtification, that without them there can be no Juſtification,</hi> that is, they are the cauſe of it, as<note n="*" place="margin">Smalc. ibid.</note> one of them is not aſhamed to write.</p>

            <p>But let us paſs to other things. As <hi>Socinians</hi> would overthrow the foundation of the Church, namely, that Chriſt is the proper Son of the living God, ſo his Church they would make unknown and undiſcernable, and ſo confound thoſe who would find out, which and what it is? Becauſe every one who is deſirous of Salvation, which is to be gotten only in Chriſt's Church, would go about clearing to himſelf whether or not he be a Member of that true Church, becauſe alſo there is the Synagogue of Satan; therefore there are ſome certain proper marks and characters whereby to know it; theſe make a great Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy between <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts:</hi> But <hi>Socinians</hi> would

               <hi>Smalcius</hi> plainly denies <hi>the ſincere preaching of the word and the right uſe of the Sacraments,</hi> (which all Proteſtants affirm) <hi>to be the true marks of Chriſt's Church:</hi> he alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that the right uſe of Sacraments may be among ſome <hi>who are not God's people,</hi> a ſtrange doctrine indeed, for there is no right uſe without a ſound mind and an upright heart, which can be found only among God's people.</p>
            <p>Another great error they have about the Church is this, <hi>the Church</hi> ſaith <hi>Socinus, may totally fail for ſeveral Ages, and hath actually failed;</hi> this, as I am apt to believe, and I elſewhere have given my reaſon for it, tends to ſuggeſt that the true Church was loſt till he came and did ſet it up: we own that at ſometimes of great Perſecution to Man's Eye it was inviſible, yet for all that there was a Church:<note place="margin">1 King 1.19.14.18.</note> though <hi>Elijah</hi> thought, <hi>he only was left,</hi> yet <hi>God had ſeven thouſand left in</hi> Iſrael <hi>who had not bowed the knee unto</hi> Baal, whom the Prophet during that Cruel Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution by <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezebel,</hi> could not ſee: this of the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> the like of the Chriſtian Church, which is well called Catholick or Univerſal, in relation to both times and places; and as it hath been ſo from the Apoſtles time, ſo it ſhall be to the World's end; there have been Believers in all Ages, and of all Nations, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, and ſometimes leſs.</p>
            <p>Furthermore they attempt bringing a Confuſion into the Church (for they are Enemies to all ſetled Churches) with going about to deſtroy in it the Miniſtery by way of Office <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> witneſs theſe words of <hi>Socinus</hi> denying a neceſſity of Ordination in the Church. <hi>Non video,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I ſee no reaſon why a Man verſed in Scriptures, and of probity, may not take that office upon himſelf:</hi> ſo ſay the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> but nothing weaker and leſs pertinent than this can be ſaid upon the matter, eſpecially by one who ſo highly pretended to be Maſter of reaſon: becauſe he ſee a not, will not, or by reaſon of prejudices cannot ſee, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <note place="margin">John. 20.21. Chap. 17.18. Rom. 1.1.</note> And to the Father he ſaith, <hi>as thou haſt ſent me into the World, even have I alſo ſent them into the World:</hi> ſo the Commiſſion of the Miniſtery of the Church came at firſt and Originally from Heaven: thus <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſpeaks of his Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, mentions his calling thereunto <hi>Paul called to be an Apoſtle:</hi> 'tis true his Vocation was extraordinary, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, <hi>Paul an Apoſtle not of men, neither by man, but by Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.1. Gal. 1.1.

            </p>
            <p>Thus he Sacrilegiouſly intruded not himſelf into that Office, but a Lawful call he had, at firſt that call of Miniſters was extraordinary, the Apoſtles who had it, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately called, and extraordinarily endued with Gifts by the Holy Ghoſt, but when things began to be ſetled there was an Ordinary Vocation or Ordination called the <hi>laying</hi> and <hi>puting on of the Hands:</hi> thus ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> to his Diſciple,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.6. 1 Tim. 4.14.</note>

About theſe things, and in all Diſputes concerning Religion we ought to have a rule to go by, and that is Scripture well explained and underſtood, that is according to the true ſignification of the Words and Senſe in the Original, the ſcope of the Place, and the analogy of Faith; this rule muſt be true and certain, which cannot be as long as every one is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to turn it to his own Senſe and private Interpretation:<note n="*" place="margin">Jonah Schlich. ting. in Symb.

            <p>It is very unreaſonable in them to go about ſetting up their own private Opinions over and above, and to the prejudice of the publick and univerſal ones, 'tis too much

            <p>But as their Principles are dangerous to the Church, ſo they are to the State, for they would not allow the Magiſtrate, either in the legiſlative or executive part of the Government, in matters of Religion to puniſh any, though never ſo great offenders, yet by the Laws of God, Blaſphemy and Idolatry were puniſhed with Death, and as they agree with the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> againſt the Magiſtrates puniſhing for Hereſy, and for leaving every one to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his own Opinions; ſo for all their fair pretences, they are with them for a liberty in practices, and againſt compelling any Man to a Godly Life, which is an inlet to all manner of Immorality, as the other is a gap to every Hereſy. In relation to the Magiſtrate, <hi>Socinians</hi> do joyn in moſt of their wrong Notions about it, and though they do not poſitively and abſolutely ſay the Chriſtian Magiſtrate to be incapable of bearing the Sword,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:30142:28"/>yet they ſay as good, for they would not have him to draw it out of the Scabbard, meaning againſt them, tho' for never ſo juſt and neceſſary a cauſe, eſpecially about matters of Religion, which they wholly exclude from his Juriſdiction, yet as the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> did at <hi>Munſter,</hi> ſo there is ſufficient ground to believe, that if the <hi>Socinians</hi> could ſnatch the Power out of the hand of the Chriſtian Magiſtrates that are againſt them, and lodge it in their own, no queſtion but they would uſe their utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours there to keep it; and like the <hi>Circumcellions,</hi> a ſort of <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> deſtroy all that are not of their Religion.</p>
            <p>In few words, theſe are the right Notions we muſt have of the Magiſtrate, <hi>firſt</hi> that God is the Author there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whom he conſtitutes as his <hi>Vice-gerent</hi> upon Earth, thus he gave his People Captains, Judges, and Kings, who are all by his own appointment, for, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>the Powers that be, are ordained of God.

               <hi>hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted adultery with her already in his heart:</hi> So to the ſame purpoſe he ſpeaks about Murther, wherein he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears very far from diſpenſing from the ſtrictneſs of the Law, whileſt he preſſeth the inward Obedience in the Heart; but to return to the <hi>Socinianp</hi>-rinciple about aboliſhing and moderating the Moral Law, and putting no Man to Death for any Crimes, it is of a dangerous Conſequence, for after this rate, 'tis not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful either for the Prince by Arms to ſtand in the juſt defence of himſelf or of his Subjects, nor for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to take up Arms to defend themſelves and their Prince: Thus if <hi>Socinians</hi> had the upper hand, and were about to deſtroy thoſe who oppoſe them, then they would not have the Magiſtrate make uſe of Arms againſt them, though Blaſphemers and Seditious: there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things more of that nature, which I omit for fear of engaging too far in ſo fulſome a matter, leaving it for thoſe whom it doth concern, to make farther Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon't.</p>
            <p>However, as to the uſe of forcible means, I ſay we are againſt it, thereby to promote and propagate, but not to defend Religion, if by Arms it be aſſaulted, by the ſame it may be defended, for <hi>Vim vî repellere licet;</hi> an unjuſt Violence may juſtly be repulſed; yet we by no means do approve of the Popiſh interpretation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that Text, <hi>Compell them to come in.</hi> Thoſe that are without may not well be forced, but invited and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:30142:31"/>co come in; but the caſe is very different for thoſe who are in, for being Members of a Church, or of a State, or of both, as they enjoy the benefit of the Laws, ſo they muſt not preſume to break them; but in things not againſt God's commands, they muſt be made to yield Obedience thereunto, curb'd and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd when they do the contrary, and when gentle and fair means have been try'd, but prove ineffectual; this is not to violate the Conſcience, but to break the obſtinacy of the Mind about Fundamentals in Religion. I own this was not practiſed by the Apoſtles, nor in their time, becauſe, indeed it was not their work, nor their Commiſſion, which was of another nature, but at that time there were no Chriſtian Magiſtrates, all Jews or Gentiles; but the thing went otherwiſe, when Emperours and other Men of Authority in the World became Chriſtians, then they became Nurſing Fathers to the Church, defended and maintained it againſt her Enemies, by Arms againſt thoſe who therewith aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and by Councils againſt thoſe who would have undermin'd her Doctrines. And ſo it ought now to be againſt thoſe who impiouſly Blaſpheme that God whom the Chriſtian Church ever own'd and worſhip'd, whereunto the Adverſaries agree, for ſaith<note n="*" place="margin">Tom. <hi>1.</hi> Sol.

What Treaſon is in Humane things, that in ſome kind Blaſphemy is in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; for as Treaſon is againſt the King's Perſon or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſo Blaſphemy is againſt God's Nature, or his Works, now as Treaſon is juſtly puniſh'd, ſo there is a Puniſhment due to Blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>But to come to other things, I ſay that for all their pretences to Piety and Vertue, their Principles lead quite to the contrary, and what I am going to ſay, though there was nothing elſe can bring it home upon them; here I poſitively charge them by means of ſome of their damnable Opinions to encourage Vice, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, Immorality, with all manner of Wickedneſs, and this, by the Grace of God, I can make good, ſo

            <p>But the Devil, though he be God's Ape, and would imitate him, for as God hath his Church, ſo Satan hath his Synagogue, his Laws and Miniſters; yet inſtead of bringing Men to Heaven, as he ſometimes with his falſe ſuggeſtions would pretend, puts them in the ready way to Hell, and with his Snares doth cheat and trick them into it, in order thereunto he ſtudies the temper and conſtitution of thoſe Men whom he would draw to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and offers ſuitable baits and temptations to effect it,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.6.</note> thus with the offer of a <hi>Fruit that was good for Food and pleaſant to the Eye,</hi> Eve was overcome by his Temptation: Contrary to what our Saviour practiſed, he doth what he can to pleaſe Man's humour and corrupt nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he makes uſe of his Inſtruments: thus that great Impoſtor <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to ſatisfy his ambition, luſt, and other carnal affections, he knowing how much, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion, Men are apt to be miſled, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſet up one, whereof ſome things of <hi>Paganiſm, Judaiſm,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianiſm</hi> were the ingredients, but he adapted it to the inclinations, manners, and cuſtoms of thoſe whom he intended to bring into it, and finding

            <p>Thus among Chriſtians, ſome wretches, whom, being puffed up with ſelf-conceit and deſire of vain-glory, God left to themſelves to fall by their own council, ſoon fell into the Devil's Snares, who gave a wrong edge to what natural parts they had, and qualify'd them for his drudgery: and as <hi>Self-denyal</hi> is the firſt thing which our Saviour preſcribes his Deſciples, ſo on the contrary Satan begins with infuſing and promoting <hi>Self-love;</hi> his inſtruments do follow his ſteps, and by all means go about to gratify it: among ſuch I reckon <hi>Socinus,</hi> who to gain Proſelytes, firſt of all to make the Religion he was ſetting up eaſy, preſcribed very few things to believe and to do, accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated and fitted them to the natural inclination and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature of Men, which are very dangerous ſnares; withal to draw Men of all Sects and Sorts, he made ſuch a mixture, that moſt, if not every Heretick, might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in find ſomething for his Opinions; he makes the way to Heaven wide and eaſy for a Man of any Sect, without departing from his errours to come to it: there is in Man a repugnancy to be gainſaid, and a ſtrong deſire of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in our opinions of things, diſcourſes, and actions; accordingly <hi>Socinus</hi> allows it to the full, for in his School, you may believe what you pleaſe, make new Arcicles of Faith, reject old ones, undervalue Chriſt, and rob him of his due as much as you can and dare, and have the liberty to cenſure the Opinion of others, which is very plauſible to fleſh and blood:<note place="margin">Gal. 1.16.</note> but <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>how after his Converſion he conferred not with fleſh and blood.</hi> And as to their preſuming ſo much upon Scripture, with giving their own interpretations ſuch as they pleaſe: he tells, <hi>I ſay thorough the Grace given unto me,</hi>

The <hi>ſecond</hi> thing is the general diſpoſition in men to fall into thoſe ſnares, and contrary to the dictates of Truth and ſound Reaſon, to entertain falſe Notions, becauſe they ſeem left to their choice to the prejudice of thoſe Truths which have along with them a Command over our conſent and belief: thorough ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and outward appearances of Modeſty, Humility, deſire of rhe Truth and the like <hi>dephts</hi> and <hi>devices of Satan, which</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>we are not ignorant of,</hi> and by theſe ſhares of the Devil,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.24.

            </p>
            <p>A thing which very much help'd <hi>Socinus</hi> to ſet up his errours, is this: when he came into <hi>Poland,</hi> he found that Country rent in pieces by ſeveral Factions and Sects of <hi>Antitrinitarians</hi> who were more intent to deſtroy the Opinions of their <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> than to confirm their own:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30142:37"/>ſo he being a ſubtle and Crafty <hi>Italian,</hi> newly come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, acted his part ſo Cunningly as to get himſelf to be the head, wherein he was favoured by the State and Conſtitution of that Kingdom where great Men have much Power, and great Influences, that Nation being ſtiled <hi>Martialis ferox</hi> upon the account of the fierce and Arbitrary Spirit of Men of Quality, and the ordinary people very much kept under by them, not daring to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he being there, to ſtrenghten himſelf, made a <hi>Rapſody</hi> of moſt Hereſies before him and of others then on Foot in thoſe parts, which he would never have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in <hi>Italy</hi> for fear of Fire and Fagot, nor in <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whence he was forced to fly away; and to pleaſe <hi>Heterodox</hi> Men of all ſorts, he therewith compiled that unhappy <hi>Syſtem</hi> of his, wholly or in part to engage greater Numbers of Men to defend it. At that time <hi>Poland</hi> abounded in Monſtrous Opinions which he cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and join'd together, and notwithſtanding ſome divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, did ſet up for head of all, this Man from his Youth began to be fitted to produce Monſtrous things, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Uncles Directions, he being born within the State of <hi>Toſcany</hi> which generally brings forth the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd Wits of all <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſo I may ſay of <hi>Europe,</hi> had working brains of his own, which prompted him to new things, and as <hi>Italians,</hi> are very apt to indulge their natural Genius, which by experience I know in theſe late times, commonly to lead them to miſchief, as we have a late inſtance in the perſon of <hi>Borri</hi> who among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Extravagant alterations, which he made in ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion, for which he was in the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and is now, if not lately dead, under confinement during Life, in the Caſtle <hi>San Angelo</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> he made the <hi>Virgin</hi> a Goddeſs, of the ſame Nature with God; ſo <hi>Socinus</hi> had ſeveral Contemporaries and Compatriots whom I nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed elſewhere, who with him acted their parts upon the ſame Stage. Now I ſay, <hi>Socinus</hi> being a buſy Man of an active and ſtirring Spirit, and in his time matters of Religion, being the general diſcourſe of the World, he apply'd his Wits that way, and though may be at firſt, he was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo bad as he proved at laſt, he began by degrees, ſo publiſh'd with a diſguiſed name <hi>Caſtellio's Pelagian</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, afterwards his Book <hi>de Chriſto Servatore;</hi> as when an Enemy goes about to beſiege a place, he begins with the outworks and ſo by degrees comes to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30142:38"/>thus Chriſt's Enemies begin with acting againſt his Grace, and at laſt do attack his Perſon.</p>
            <p>He and his followers uſe to ſlight and unconcernedly to ſpeak of Holy things and of Religion thus, <hi>it ſeems to me, I ſee nothing,</hi> and the like: according to that Spirit they little care what interpretations they make of God's Word, which thus they impiouſly make a ſtalking Horſe of to their wandring Thoughts and for ſiniſter ends of their own, namely, as they and our modern <hi>Socinians</hi> here ſay, to improve theit Parts, promote Learning and make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>Another thing they do, as may be ſeen in moſt of their late Pamphlets (which indeed is neither fit nor decent) is often to commend themſelves, and bring in others who ſpeak well of them, but it had been much better not to have brought themſelves under a neceſſity to need Begging or Borrowing ſuch Certificates of their good behaviour.

But 'tis fit I ſhould ſay ſomething in vindication of that Famous and firſt Chriſtian General Council, ſummon'd by a Chriſtian Emperour, now when by this occaſion I am put upon it.</p>
            <p>We muſt not wonder if ſome Heretick condemned by the Council, ſuch as <hi>Sabinus</hi> at that time the head Man of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Hereſy, and now our <hi>Samaritan</hi> would reflect upon it, but the account we have of the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe who were in the Council is much different
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:30142:39"/>and contrary to what he would inſinuate, there were Men of great Learning, Piety, Exemplary Life, Wiſe, Eloquent, Sober, Diſcreet, Modeſt, and of Courteous Behaviour; ſome conſiderable for their ſufferings, and others reſpected for their great age, and as that Aſſembly was notable for Quality, ſo for number, there being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 300 Biſhops, of which number were <hi>Paphnutins, Spiridion, Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> &amp;c. Men of great Fame, with a vaſt number of other Divines, with ſeveral Lay-Men, good Philoſophers to aſſiſt them, therefore not ſo deſpicable as unworthily and falſly he would traduce it, ſo conſiſted not of wrangling <hi>Greeks,</hi> but if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve<note n="*" place="margin">Conſtant. <hi>l. 3.</hi>

               <hi>Euſebius,</hi> there were Divines out of <hi>Egypt, Lybia, Theboea, Arabia, Paleſtina, Phoenicia, Syria, Cilicia, Galatia, Pamphilia, Cappadocia, Pontus, Perſia, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Phrygia,</hi> one from <hi>Scythia,</hi> and <hi>Hoſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Corduba</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> much eſteem'd by the Emperour: alſo there were ſome from <hi>Macedonia, Thracia,</hi> as out of <hi>Achaia</hi> and <hi>Epirus.</hi> This I mention not only to ſhew his want of Sincerity and Truth, and that the Council was not contemptible as to the quality and number of Perſons, as he would make it, but to demonſtrate how weighty, upon ſeveral accounts, was <hi>Arius</hi>'s condemnation by ſo Eminent an Aſſembly, with the Emperour at the head, who was a Pious and Wiſe Prince, as his Carriage during the whole time of the Council, declared him to be. Beſides that, every one was allowed to ſay and defend his Opinion, ſo things were not raſhly carried on, but ſeriouſly ſifted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, as for inſtance in the explanation of the word <hi>homoouſius</hi> of the ſame ſubſtance which admitted of great debates, wherein the cautious <hi>Euſebius Pamphilus</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much, it was agreed that the Son is of the Father, but not part of the Father: after all, the Council at laſt by a free and unanimous conſent, agreed upon the Creed from the place call'd <hi>Nicene,</hi> which was ſigned by no leſs then 318 Biſhops: well by that Council ſo lawfully aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and after the debates which upon ſuch occaſions are uſual, was <hi>Arius</hi> and all of his Opinion Anathematized, he in particular forbidden to go into <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where he lived before, and by the Emperour baniſh'd. Now People may ſee what kind of Aſſembly was that famous Council, which our preſent <hi>Samaritan</hi> would revile: had it been <hi>Socinus</hi>'s caſe as 'twas <hi>Arius</hi>'s, he ſhould have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:30142:40"/>the ſame Condemnation, who in one point chiefly is worſe than <hi>Arius,</hi> who ſaid our Saviour had by way of Creation a Being before the Virgin's time, and was the firſt of the Creatures, which, after <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus, Socinians</hi> deny. The Council in their Synodical Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> calls <hi>Arius</hi>'s Tenets <hi>his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious opinions, or rather madneſs and blaſphemous expreſſions.</hi> So do <hi>Socinian</hi> Hereſies deſerve to be call'd.</p>
            <p>Here I ſhall add how the Council condemned not only the Heretick and his Opinions, but alſo a Book of his call'd <hi>Thalia,</hi> to ſhew how one of the ways to ſuppreſs Hereſy, is alſo to ſuppreſs Heretical Books: after this came in the civil Authority and acted its part; firſt the Emperour did upon the buſineſs write an excellent Letter to the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and after into other parts; alſo he ordered that if any of <hi>Arius</hi>'s Books could be met with, they preſently ſhould be burnt, and farther declared that if any Perſon happened to have any of his Books, and did not immediately produce and burn it, he ſhould, upon his being found guilty, preſently ſuffer death: and 'tis to be obſerved how herein the Emperour acted in his civil Capacity, and in the laſt Letter, with no relation to the Council, which he doth not ſo much as name. And to carry on his Zeal farther, <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Arians</hi> to make them more odious and deteſtable, he branded them, ordering they ſhould be called <hi>Porphyrians,</hi> from <hi>Porphyrius</hi> an impious and utter enemy to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; herein we ſee a happy union between Church and State, to puniſh and ſuppreſs Blaſphemy and Hereſy, and when that wicked Man by means of intrigues had been readmitted into the Emperour's Preſence, upon condition to ſubſcribe and ſwear to the determinations of the Council, which both he did, and thereupon thought all ſafe for himſelf, from Man's ſide whom he had deluded, and to have again been admitted into the Church. God who cannot be deceived and will not be mocked, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Judgment upon him, for the day before he ſhould have been reſtored, in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in a Houſe of Office, where he was gone to eaſe himſelf, his Bowels fell out of his Body, which before had been <hi>Judas</hi>'s Puniſhment, as being cruſhed to death by the fall of an Houſe, had been that of <hi>Corinthus.</hi> So let all the Son of God's enemies be confounded if they will not be converted.</p>

            <p>After what I hitherto obſerved of them, and of their Principles, theſe following things I offer to the Serious conſideration of the Reader, but more eſpecially to that of the Government and Magiſtracy which are more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly concern'd. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That our Controverſies againſt <hi>Socinians,</hi> are not about indifferent things or few Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, but concerning the moſt Fundamental Truths of our Holy Religion, for the Doctrines of the Trinity, of two Natures in Chriſt, of his Satisfaction, of the Grace and Providence of God, are not Problematical, nor meerly School diſputes, but of the neceſſity of Chriſtian Faith: I alſo affirm that <hi>Socinians</hi> are Chriſtians only in Name, not really and in Truth, for they own not Chriſt, for what he is: and if the<note n="*" place="margin">Athan. orat. <hi>3.4.</hi> cont. Arian.</note> Ancient Doctors of the Church, reckoned the <hi>Arians</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſo we now may account <hi>Socinians</hi> to be; <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, made an Edict for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding the <hi>Porphyrians</hi> to be call'd Chriſtians, and that all their Books ſhould be Burnt; ſo this were the proper Courſe to ſuppreſs thoſe of <hi>Socinians,</hi> but inſtead of that, they are ſuffered not only daily to Print new ones, but alſo to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print old ones, and thus not only here at home, but alſo to have them from abroad. <hi>Socinians</hi> do not truly confeſs Chriſt, ſeeing they deny he hath Divine Nature, and make of him but a ſecondary God, an Idol and a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture God, then which nothing more abſurd.</p>
            <p>I farther ſay, they ought not to be ſuffered to have Communion with the Church, becauſe they do not together with us, know, own and Worſhip the true God
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30142:42"/>who is Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, but they pretend to Worſhip one firſt God the Father, and another infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour God made ſuch that is the Son, moreover they lay another foundation than that is laid,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.11.</note> for inſtead of Chriſt who is a Divine Perſon with two Natures, they ſet up an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Perſon, who is a meer Man; ſeeing than they lay another Foundation, deny Chriſt Son of God, to be come in the Fleſh, and do not adore him with us, for ſuch as he is, than we may have no Brotherly Communication with them: than they have not with us the ſame waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Blood of Chriſt, and do not believe therewith to be Purged and Sanctify'd, for they deny his Satisfaction, that he hath laid down a Price to Redeem us: they far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deny or depravate the cauſes and means of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and are guilty of Idolatry for paying a Religious Worſhip to him who is not God by Nature, and though they would be thought to be Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, yet they deny his Perſon and betray his Truth.</p>
            <p>I add, they Love not Chriſt, (and againſt ſuch,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.22.</note> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle pronounces <hi>Anathema</hi>) for they Blaſpheme againſt him, they pretend to love him, only as a Creature, when he ſhould be loved as Creator: then they are not Pious, for ſuch cannot be ſaid to live piouſly, who deprive the true God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, of the Honour due to him, and they are highly miſtaken when they would make civil honeſty to be Chriſtian Piety, and the true knowledge of God, and a conſtant profeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not to be a neceſſary part of Piety.</p>
            <p>They ought not to be ſuffered in a Chriſtian State, ſo as to have liberty of Conſcience, with free exerciſe of and teaching or publiſhing their Blaſphemous and Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Opinions, becauſe they overthrow the foundation of Chriſtian Religion, to the diſhonour of God's Holy Name, ſeduction of Souls, and diſturbance of the Church: and as 'tis a Collection of fundamental Hereſies, ſo to tolerate <hi>Socinians</hi> is thereby to tolerate all thoſe Hereſies, whereby God's Judgments are drawn upon Nations, wherefore Pious Chriſtian Emperours and Kings, to promote the Glory of God, ever took care to ſuppreſs Hereſies and Blaſphemies, as the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories do fully prove it, and thereupon let <hi>Juſtinian's Code</hi> be conſulted againſt the Hereſies of <hi>Photinus,</hi> and of <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> which <hi>Socinians</hi> do openly profeſs.

And do acknowledge the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, to be the Revealed or Written Word or Will of God, ſhall not be reſtrained from their Profeſſion,</hi> &amp;c. Which plainly imports that thoſe who deny the Holy Trinity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be reſtrained: in the ſame Article, they alſo exclude from that Liberty, <hi>Popery</hi> or any that held forth Licentiouſneſs, or Prophaneſs, under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion. Theſe things not uſual to come from an Army, were very good. Alſo the late Act of Toleration which in the latter part of this Diſcourſe I ſhall have occaſion to make uſe of, excludes all <hi>Anti-Trinitarians</hi> from the benefit of it. And <hi>Hobb's Leviathan</hi> was in <hi>October</hi> 1666. Condemned by the Parliament in their Bill againſt <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and Prophaneneſs. And both that and his Book, <hi>de Cive,</hi> by the Convocation in <hi>July</hi> 21. 1683. all this ſhews how from time to time and upon occaſion here care hath been taken juſtly to puniſh Blaſphemers, that they might learn not to Blaſpheme, and be made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to others, for they are a publick raging Plague, deſtructive whereſoever they be, not to be ſuffered to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:30142:44"/>profeſs and publiſh their Blaſphemies in any Chriſtian State or Society. When God's time is come, and he will be pleaſed to incline the Hearts, and over-rule the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of Men to ſtand againſt Blaſphemy, Prophaneneſs, and Immorality (which all except Blaſphemers, Prophane and Immoral Livers will do) then the nature of them that are guilty thereof, and whom we do and ſhall complain againſt till there be a relief, muſt well be conſidered to make the remedy effectual: experience ſhews them to be proud, willful, obſtinate, and inſolent, ſtrong mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, therefore require ſtrong curbs and to be hard bound; in order to it, 'tis humbly conceived, and with poſſible reſpect ſubmitted to the judgment of Superiours, how the words of a new Law, when enacted, ought to be full and plain, that when it comes to be executed, there be no ground left for difficulties and exceptions, ſo that therein the end of the Law be ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, and the things 'tis intend againſt, clearly ſet down; 'tis but to dally with and flatter the diſtemper, not to lay ſtrict and ſenſible penalties upon all that ſpeak, writ, or otherwiſe directly or indirectly do oppoſe the Truth, and appear for the Sin: Firſt the Authors, Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Fomenters, Printers, or other Publiſhers ought to feel the ſeverity of the Law, not only in a privative way as to be made incapable of any publick charge or office whatſoever in Church or State, but alſo to ſtrike a terrour and come nearer home, to inflict Money penalties, and the like, for the fear of a <hi>pecuniary mulct,</hi> will work upon ſome Men, whether Author's, Printers, or Publiſhers, but as 'tis not enough to puniſh the Perſons, but alſo the things muſt be ſuppreſs'd, thereupon a Prohibition to Print any more New Pamphlets and Books tending to Propagate Hereſy and Blaſphemy, is as neceſſary as the Burning or otherwiſe Deſtroying thoſe which already are abroad: no Bookſeller under ſuch a Penalty ſhould be allowed to have any in his Shop, not to diſtribute any either publickly or in private: thoſe that are abroad ſhould be called in, and Publickly Burnt, and none, few excepted, be allowed to keep any, no more than they are to have Treaſonable Books and againſt the State. This would make People have a care how they meddle with ſuch things. Laſtly, to make a Law more Effectual, it requires great and ſevere penalties againſt thoſe who are
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:30142:44"/>to execute the Law as Juſtices of the Peace, Conſtables and others concern'd, if they neglect it: the executive part is the Life and Soul of the Law, without which 'tis inſignificant; we already have ſeveral Laws in force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Blaſphemy, Prophaneneſs and immorality whereof an abſtract was publiſh'd not long ago! 'tis both pity and a ſhame they are not put in execution, and no body puniſh'd for want of it: a good new Act to revive them all would much tend to the Glory of God, the Church's Good, the Honour and Happineſs of the Nation, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Piety and Vertue, and to ſuppreſs all manner of Sin, whether in Doctrine or Practice.</p>
            <p>We read of the ten Plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and we complain of the like number of the Adverſaries evil Practices, which in matters controverted between them and us, they plague the World with, as ſince their beginning they ever did, and now continue to do, there is hardly any proſpect to hope that in time to come they will alter, for thorough a long cuſtom, they in their Hearts, where the plague lyeth, have turn'd it into an habit, they want Sincerity and deal not fairly: thus to make them appear in their own colours and ſhew how much they prevaricate, we charge them with the ten following things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> they wreſt God's Word to confirm their Doctrines, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of examining their Doctrines by that word according to the Analogy of Faith, and the general conſent of the Chriſtian Church. <hi>Secondly,</hi> they introduce ſtrange, perverſe, unheard of and condemn'd Senſes and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations contrary to the uſual ſignification of the words and phraſes of Scripture, and to the Scope of the Texts. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they take the liberty at their pleaſure to alter and change the full <hi>ſtops, Commas, Colons, Letters, Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables,</hi> and whole words, and this to ſet up their Doctrines and falſe Interpretations; as alſo at ſometimes they add, at others they take away to ſerve their ends, which in maters of Religion is what in civil ones we call to forge and falſify deeds, a very infamous thing, but worſe in matters of Religion, becauſe to the falſehood are join'd Impiety and Sacrilege. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> to the light of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation they oppoſe that of Human Reaſon, which is dark, weak, deceitful, and fallible, as by experience we find in Humane and Natural Things; but the other is clear, certain, infallible, and leading us to the knowledge of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:30142:45"/>Truth. Points of Faith muſt not be examined by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon, which is often contrary to it. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> they digg up out of their Graves ancient and condemn'd Hereſies to revive them, like a new Plague to be ſpread again over the Chriſtian World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Not only they will not confine themſelves within the bounds of the received Faith by the Primitive Church, but do forge new Articles of Faith, and cannot forbear giving ill language, revilings, and lies. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> they deſpiſe and contemptuouſly reject the Teſtimonies and Witneſſes of the Doctors of the Primitive Church againſt all rules of decency and modeſty. <hi>Eighthly,</hi> they take upon themſelves peremptorily and magiſterially to blame and condemn all Chriſtian Proteſtant Churches, as if they knew nothing and were nothing, which in them is an effect of raſhneſs and pride. <hi>Ninethly,</hi> not only they cannot forbear oppoſing the fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtian Religion, but alſo will not abſtain from Impieties, Blaſphemies, and abominable Expreſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the moſt Holy Trinity, the Divinity of the Son of God, who is the God of the Chriſtians, againſt his Incarnation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it hath already been plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated: ſuch deteſtable things, the Apoſtles never did againſt the Idols of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for we read how the Town-Clerk of <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſaid to the People,<note place="margin">Acts 19.37.</note> 
               <hi>ye have brought hither theſe Men which are neither Robbers of Churches, nor yet Blaſphemers of your Goddeſs:</hi> the Apoſtles were for deſtroying Idolatry, but therein they behaved themſelves with a Chriſtian Prudence and Modeſty, though in a good cauſe; thus <hi>Paul</hi> calmly upon the account of the Altar to the unknown God,<note place="margin">Chap. 17.23.</note> ſaid to the <hi>Athenians, whom ye ignorantly Worſhip, him declare I unto you:</hi> diſputed with good arguments not with injuries; according to the rule he gives his Diſciple,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.24.25.</note>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> for the oneneſs of God lies in the Unity of Nature, not of Perſons. Now I come to them and ſay,</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:30142:45"/>
            <p>Our Doctrine conſiſts with it ſelf, for one of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why we confeſs Chriſt to be God, is, becauſe we know there is but one true God; but yours contradicts it ſelf, becauſe ye make two Gods of different Natures, when there is no true God, but he that is ſuch by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſo if there is but one God, there muſt be only one Divine Nature, and none is God, but he who hath that Divine Nature; and if we worſhip thoſe who by Nature are not Gods, we worſhip falſe Gods, and are Idolaters: To make Gods of ſeveral Natures, is meer <hi>Polytheiſm,</hi> and Plurality of Gods, which Scripture is ſo much againſt; but to have ſeveral Perſons, yet of one and the ſame Nature, doth not make many Gods; ſo that when we affirm there is but one Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we aſſert the Oneneſs of God, whilſt they with affirming there are two Gods of different Natures, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that Unity which conſiſts in the Eſſence or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore the Name <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> which they call themſelves by, is <gap reason="foreign">

Beſides, let it be taken notice of, what kind of God they would make our Saviour to be, a God not born but made, a God by office and favour, not by nature, a God who had a beginning and ſhall have an end, and at laſt be ſtripp'd of his Divinity: a God who is not the firſt and ſhall not be the laſt, who hath not made Heaven and Earth, which the Apoſtle after a Prophet gives as a Character of the true God; a God not ſuch by Nature,<note place="margin">Acts 17.24.

               <hi>God bleſſed for ever,</hi> which is to make a God no God, and as much as in them lies, to ridicule the Godhead; a God who hath not his Being of himſelf, and is not the Author of being to the Creature, which all are abſurd Contradictions: But I elſewhere abundantly proved our Saviour and Lord to be of the ſame Nature with the Father by an eternal
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:30142:46"/>generation. Is it not very abſurd and contradictious to give one the Eſſential Attributes of Divine Nature, yet deny him Divine Nature, which is inſeparable from thoſe Attributes, ſo that where the Nature is, there the Attributes muſt alſo be, and where the Attributes, ſo muſt alſo the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? 'Tis very ſtrange that this people look upon't as a thing impoſſible, for God to communicate his Nature to one whom they own to have received Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Wiſdom, Power, and that Divine Worſhip is his due, which are proper Attributes of Divine Nature, not really diſtinct, but inſeparable from it. When men pay honour to a Perſon, they firſt of all in their mind muſt be ſatisfied, how in that Perſon is ſome Excellency and Dignity which deſerves it, and this leads them upon this account, to make their Heart and Affections willing to entertain a ſingular Veneration for that perſon. Hence in the <hi>third</hi> place, ariſes a deſire and reſolution by ſome outward acts to expreſs the inward diſpoſition to the Glory and Honour of that Perſon, and to let other men ſee and know it: Now to have firſt ſuch a Notion of a meer Creature, ſuch they affirm our Lord to be, then in the heart to receive ſuch impreſſions of rendring honour to ſuch a perſon, and <hi>laſtly</hi> by ſome outward act to declare it; this I ſay, is perfect Idolatry, for 'tis to do for the Creature all that can be done for the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who unto himſelf alone hath reſerved that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip, for 'tis written, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Out of this it appears, how their Opinion ſets up <hi>Polytheiſm</hi> and Idolatry; for to affirm two Perſons of different Nature, is certainly to make two different Gods, and wholly to deſtroy the Unity of the Godhead; for as they own a Plurality of Perſons, ſo they do a Plurality of Natures: how then can they find the Oneneſs of God, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in will they make it conſiſt?</p>
            <p>Neither can they waſh off the charge of Idolatry for rendring to Chriſt, whom they ſay to be a meer Man, and a Creature, the Worſhip due to the moſt high God, which to maintain, they ſink deeper into the mire; for by one Idolatry they would defend another, and by one falſe thing another as falfe: They ſay, that before the coming of Chriſt, <hi>ſuch</hi>

            <p>Before I leave off this point, I ſhall in a few Words take notice, how nice in the Primitive Church Men were about the Unity of Eſſence and Trinity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: When the Hereſies there againſt appeared abroad, this very thing about <hi>Arrius</hi>'s time, was like to have made a great breach between the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Churches, which through <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s Piety, Care and Prudence, was prevented: The Controverſie was about the Greek word <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> and the Latin one <hi>Perſona.</hi> The Latins ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the Greek word might ſignifie Eſſence and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which had brought in the Hereſie of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts,</hi> of three Gods, for thus three Eſſences had made three Gods; on the other ſide, the Greeks thought by the Latin word to be meant only a Relation and Office, and not truly a Perſon, which had been a meer Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive diſtinction, but nothing real in't; thus the Doctrine of the Trinity had been overthrown, and ſo <hi>Sabellianiſm,</hi> which ſaith, that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, are but one Perſon, had been brought in; but in the Synod of <hi>Alexandria, Athanaſius</hi> having to remove all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion from both ſides, propoſed, that the words <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſis</hi>

            <p>We know it to have been the practice of all Hereticks who would not downright deny Scriptures, but keep an outward ſhew as if they own'd them, to come in, and by a ſide Wind to corrupt the Truths therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and no Sect went on in that way more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, preſumptuouſly and obſtinately than <hi>Socinians,</hi> who would make of it a tool, with wreſting and falſifying them to ſerve their ends: and though they ſo highly pretend to an unreconcilableneſs with the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, yet therein they follow their Methods, and have taken great and unhappy pains in corrupting both the word of God, and the Writings of Men; but God, who is, and loves truth, in his infinite Wiſdom, to the confuſion of the Authors of ſuch Works of Darkneſs, brings them to light; the World hath been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the notorious Cheat of the Jeſuits of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who, with the leave of the then Prince Elector <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> borrow'd of the Library Keeper of <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> the <hi>Manuſcript</hi> of <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> about the Lives of the Popes, which they offer'd to get Printed at their own Charges, and after they had given good Security that the <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript</hi> ſhould be return'd; they had it upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that every thing therein ſhould be printed, and nothing left out, which Condition was put in, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Hiſtory of Pope <hi>Joan</hi> that was in't: But mark the Trick, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> got it Printed, and in one
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:30142:51"/>Book only, which they were engaged to put in the <hi>Palſgrave</hi>'s Library, all was according to the <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript,</hi> but that which related to Pope <hi>Joan</hi> was left out in every other Book: Which Cheat of theirs, the Library-Keeper having afterwards found out, he about it, publiſh'd his Complaint to the World: That <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript</hi> is now in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> among the reſt of the <hi>Heidelberg</hi> Library; but though, when I was in <hi>Rome,</hi> I ſeveral times uſed means to ſee it, I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obtain it, nor in <hi>Milan</hi> neither, where another <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript</hi> of the ſame is ſaid to be in the <hi>Ambroſian</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary; 'twas own'd to me, that there is one, but when I deſired to ſee it, which I did more than once, with one pretence or other 'twas ever put off: Such are the ſhifts by <hi>Papiſts</hi> uſed to conceal the proofs of a Woman having been a Pope, and an infallible Head of their Church. Thus <hi>Socinians</hi> are glad of any pretence (which to the utmoſt of their power they would improve,) to have the 7th Ver. of the 5th. Chap. of 1 <hi>John,</hi> expung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe it lies ſo heavy upon them; but the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of ſuch Practices, affords an occaſion to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and adore God's wiſe and infinite Providence with great Mercy to his Church, that notwithſtanding the malice and craftineſs of Hell and its Inſtruments, wholly or in part to ſuppreſs Holy Scripture, yet ſuch hath been his Divine Care of it, having given his People that Holy Word of his, never to fail to the Worlds end, that he hath blaſted the wicked Endeavours of all who would have depriv'd the Church of that Heavenly Bread; but through ſo many Ages, and amidſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny various Diſpenſations of his Providence, hath to this day continued whole, and in its Purity for the Good and Benefit of his People. Thus in the days of <hi>Joſiah</hi> was by <hi>Hilkiah</hi> the High Prieſt,<note place="margin">1 Kings 22.8.</note> 
               <hi>found the book of the law in the Houſe of the Lord;</hi> which was the Copy that <hi>Moſes</hi> left with them, as it appears out of 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.14. which either by the Negligence of the Prieſts had been loſt, or by the wickedneſs of Idolatrous Kings had been rejected, and in ſome kind aboliſh'd. The like care God was pleaſed to uſe at the Taking and Burning of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and of the Temple by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi> though 'tis not expreſs'd how; for we muſt not mind the Jewiſh Fabulous Stories about it;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:30142:52"/>yet ſo it was, as we gather out of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s words to <hi>Ezra,</hi>

               <hi>Thou art ſent of the King, and of his ſeven Counſellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jeruſalem according to the law of thy God, which is in thine hand.</hi> Thus God hath reſcu'd his Holy Word of the New Teſtament from the Rage and Malice of the Jews, of the Heathen, and Perſecuting Emperors, from the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry and Superſtition of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church; ſo from the attemps of <hi>Socinians,</hi> and other Hereticks whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, either in time paſt, or preſent, and will for that which is to come, to the great Comfort and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his People.</p>

               </note> elſewhere I have ſaid enough towards it, but to make the matter more plain and clear, it being ſo excellent a Text, I ſhall add ſomething more to't: There our Saviour ſpeaking of his Father compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively with himſelf, ſaith they both are one, with the Pronoun Poſſeſſive <hi>my,</hi> as he twice calls him in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Verſe;<note place="margin">ver. 27, 28.</note> he therein ſpeaks of his Sheep, and ſaith, <hi>I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any Man pluck them out of my hand.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, firſt, how he calls them his Sheep, for he by his Death purchaſed them, then as he ſpeaks Truth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, he will give Eternal Life, and is eternal Life the gift of any but of God alone? Can any one but God give Eternal Life? Yet Chriſt gives it, ſo certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they ſhall never periſh, (here by the by, is an unanſwerable Proof againſt the pretended Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy of Saints,) and the infallibility of this gift of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, he confirms by an Argument drawn out of his own power, for neither ſhall any Man pluck them out of his Hand: But becauſe to a People who lookt upon him as a meer Man,<note place="margin">ver. 29.</note> this might ſeem too high and unlikely, he gives a convincing Reaſon, <hi>my Father which gave them me, is greater</hi> and ſtronger <hi>than all, and none is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.</hi> Pray obſerve the equality of Power between him and the

            <p>I know the Idle and not in the leaſt pertinent Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they would give of the Text, namely, they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne in <hi>Conſent,</hi> but this is neither the Scope of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's words, nor is it the true and proper ſence of the place: That there is a full and perfect Agreement between God the Father, and his Son the Lord Jeſus, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>I conſent unto the law that it is good.</hi> Therefore our Saviour highly meant more than a conſent, when he ſaid, I and my

               <hi>I ſaid I am the Son of God.</hi> So if the Queſtion had been only about Oneneſs of Conſent, the Jews would never have about it made ſo much noiſe as they did.</p>
            <p>But I find my ſelf by degrees engag'd in theſe Fundamental Matters farther than I intended at firſt; yet for all this, I muſt not draw off, rather go on, and here add ſome things to ſtrengthen what I ſaid in other places, and more and more to make matters clear, I ſhall by the Grace of God fill up ſome more Leaves to prove and explain a Subject ſo excellent in its ſelf, and ſo neceſſary to be known, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle makes it his Prayer not only for the <hi>Philippians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1.9.</note> but alſo for all Believers, <hi>That our love may abound yet more and more in knowledge, and in all judgment;</hi> for our Love and Obedience to God, with our Zeal for his Glory and Service muſt be according to true and ſound Knowledge; hence it is, that of Faith, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all Chriſtian Graces, Knowledge is the firſt part, and God ſets a Brand with a dreadful threatning upon thoſe who want it,<note place="margin">Iſai. 27.11.</note> 
               <hi>It is a people of no underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore he that made them, will not have mercy on them; and he that form'd them will ſhew them no favour.</hi>

            <p>God in Scripture having ſaid nothing in vain, but all things therein being written for our Inſtruction, and ſtrengthening of our Faith, we muſt not about our Diſputes againſt <hi>Socinians,</hi> omit a kind of proof therein contain'd, which, though it be not the cleareſt, yet much to our purpoſe may be learn'd out of it: In the Old Teſtament in three ways, beſides that of <hi>

            <p>We may take notice how in theſe Viſions of the Glory of God, commonly appear'd a Man, or one like a Man, ſitting upon a Throne: why like a Man? not as if Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature in the abſtract was like the human, for ſuch a wrong notion Scripture declares againſt, but to teach how in the Godhead in the Concrete there is ſomething, or rather Perſon, Man, like Man, then more than Man, and ſomething beſides Man, which became Chriſt, made like a Man, not in every thing a Man, becauſe no Sinner. Now as the Father was never made Man, ſo it would have been improper for him to appear in the ſhape of a Man, but for the Son who in time was made Man; 'twas very proper for him to appear in that Figure, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was manifeſt in the fleſh, for though at that time he was not actually ſo, yet was accounted to be ſuch, becauſe in time to come he was ſo to be made Man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the firſt promiſe after the fall,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> 
               <hi>the Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head;</hi> not the Seed of Man immediately, though called <hi>Abraham</hi>'s and <hi>David</hi>'s Seed, but mediately, in the Womans Seed immediately, for he was made a Man by the Womans, not by the Mans Seed; his Body was formed our of her Subſtance without the help of any Man, ſo that ſhe might properly, according to the Fleſh, be call'd his Mother, but no Man might properly be named his Father, for in that reſpect he had none,<note place="margin">Luke 3.23.</note> for <hi>Joſeph</hi> was but a <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> Father to him, and <hi>David</hi> was his Father only in her who had been derived from him: he hath a Father namely God, but upon the account of another Generation; and God the Father in a moſt authentick way, from Heaven more than once, hath declared and owned him to be his Son, that is as he came from Heaven, there lies the ground of that Sonſhip; God the Father never call'd him Son of Man, but his own beloved, only begotten Son, in whom he is well pleaſed. Now in the manifeſtation of his Glory, becauſe Divine Nature hath in the Perſon of the Son mediately been united with humane Nature, and ſo God in the Perſon of the Son appearing like Man, he appears in a Nature which is his own, becauſe the Son aſſumed it: and God whether eſſentially taken or for the Perſon
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:30142:56"/>of the Father, never did or doth in the way of Mercy and Favour manifeſt himſelf but in the face of Jeſus Chriſt Mediatour, God and Man, as there is no acceſs unto God but in and thorough him, and as 'tis now, ſo it was ever from the very beginning, wherefore he is call'd <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 13.8.</note> and this is the reaſon why God manifeſted himſelf under the ſhape of a Man, to ſhew how in the Perſon of the Son, who took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him that Nature, he is reconciled to Mankind; and of old the Son appeared in that likeneſs to ſignify how in that Nature he would make our peace with, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>Now this point we intend to conclude with <hi>John</hi>'s Viſion, for if the former Viſions agree with this, and if this relates to the Son of God who was God, and before his Incarnation appeared in his Divine Glory in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Man, then with him we may well affirm <hi>he had</hi> a Being, and <hi>a Glory with the Father before the World was.</hi> That Chriſt the eternal Son of God and Redeemer of the World, is that Glorious God and Perſon who ſhewed his beloved Diſciple this Viſion in the Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> where he had by the Emperour <hi>Domitian</hi> been confin'd, as he ſaith, <hi>for the Word of God and for the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>

            <p>At this time I have inſiſted upon the head of Viſions which is one of the Claſſes out of which we draw Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Holy Trinity, and Incarnation of the Son of God: though they were more frequent under the Old Teſtament, when thoſe Holy Myſteries were not ſo plain
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:30142:59"/>as ſince they were made by the coming of our Lord and Saviour; yet God in his Infinite Wiſdom to confirm all that in that kind had been under the Law ſhew'd <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his Poſterity, hath under the Goſpel Tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Church, thereby to ſhew an harmony between his Promiſes and the Execution thereof, that Revelation to St. <hi>John,</hi> Iown there are ſome proofs, may be not ſo ſtrong, becauſe not ſo plain as others, for ſome do prove a Truth more directly and poſitively than others; yet in the Word of God every kind of proof hath its uſe, for God in his Infinite Wiſdom hath thought fit therein to inſtruct us in ſeveral ways and methods: if we had only Collateral and ſomewhat dark proofs, we would not lay ſo great a ſtreſs thereupon, but to the moſt poſitive and clear we join others to ſhew the excellent harmony that is in God's Word, in aſſerting things in ſome places more, in others leſs plainly, for ſometimes in one we find that which ſeem'd wanting in another, but altogether they make the thing to be undiſputably true.</p>
            <p>This conſideration moves me, in the diſputes we have againſt <hi>Socinans,</hi> to draw up ſome Arguments which as yet I made no uſe of, to prove and more and more demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate thoſe great Truths: of that kind the following is one, 'tis ſaid of <hi>Moſes</hi> that <hi>he eſteemed the reproach of</hi> or for <hi>Chriſt greater Riches than the Treaſures in Aegypt.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Matth. 27.39, 40, 41, 42, 43.</note> 
               <hi>wagging their heads, ſaying, if thou be the Son of God, come down from the croſs; likewiſe the chief Prieſts mocking him, with the Scribes and Elders ſaid, he ſaved others, himſelf he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſave; if he be the King of Iſrael, let him now come down from the croſs and we will believe him; he truſted in God, let him deliver him now, if he will have him, for he ſaid, I am the Son of God.</hi> Theſe laſt words contain the ground of all their malicious Blaſphemies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Socinians</hi> would have joyned with the Jews, and if for the Cauſe, no doubt alſo for the Effect. Were not theſe Reproaches againſt God, whoſe Holy Name was Impiouſly made uſe of? They Reproaching for truſting in God, and for ſaying, I am the Son of God, which, certainly, is to reproach God? but all theſe Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, and wicked Reproaches fell upon Chriſt, who was made the Object thereof; thus was fullfill'd the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:30142:60"/>Prophecy, for <hi>David</hi> pointed at him when he ſaid, <hi>The Reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me:</hi> There are two undiſputable proofs to ſhew, how in that place the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks not of himſelf, but of our Saviour; one is in the beginning of the ſame Verſe, <hi>The zeal of thy houſe hath eaten me up,</hi> to him applied; the other is <hi>ver.</hi> 21.<note place="margin">Joh. 2.17.</note> 
               <hi>In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink;</hi> and if for this Truth we want another Evidence, we have it at hand, for even Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf, but as it is written,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.3.</note> 
               <hi>The Reproaches of them that reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, fell upon me.</hi> So then if <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks truth, in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time there was that which may be call'd the Reproach of Chriſt; then in ſome ſenſe Chriſt was at that time, and that might well be, ſeeing he declared he was before <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Something more we muſt ſay about this, the better to explain it: we know Divine Nature to be impaſſible, and out of the reach of any wrong on injury: however thoſe that impiouſly attempt to do't, are accounted to have effected it, for what they could they have done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, and in God's Eye are as guilty as if they had done it: Now in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time the Son of God in his human Nature, either in Soul or Body, could not be ſenſible of any Reproaches, for he then had it not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; but according to Scripture there are two Bodies of Chriſt, his <hi>Natural,</hi> which he took long after, and the <hi>Myſtical,</hi> which at that time was in being; the Church is this Myſtical Body: From Eternity the Son of God had his Commiſſion to be Head of the Church, thereby to bring many Sons into Glory; this Commiſſion after the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World he began to execute in the Exerciſe of his Royal and Prophetical Offices, with ruling and diſpoſing things for the good of his Church, the Father having put into his hands, and made over to him the whole Adminiſtration of that Occumenical Kingdom; <hi>he is the King</hi> ſpoken of,<note place="margin">Pſal. 2.6.</note> 
               <hi>ſet upon the holy hill of Sion,</hi> who rules over, and preſerves his People from the Attempts of their Enemies, and taught them by the Prophets <hi>in whom his Spirit was;</hi> and this mediately and actually till the time came when himſelf was to perform the Work of Mediation and Redemption in the paſſive part thereof, which was his Prieſtly Office, in offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Sacrifice, and ſhedding his precious Blood for a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:30142:60"/>proper ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice, and Remiſſion of Sins: This was the part of human Nature to ſuffer, but all the while before, the Work was going on, not by means of human Soul and Body, which at that time he had not; how then could the Myſtical Body, the Church, live and be acted if there had been no Head? and how there be a Head, if there had been no Being? Seeing then there could be no ſuch Body without a Head, and that no Man nor Angel could be that Head, who then but a God could be it? Therefore all the while before the Incarnation, Divine Nature in the Second Perſon of the moſt Holy Trinity, was acting in the ordering and delivering his People out of the <hi>Flood,</hi> out of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and puniſhing their Enemies, as we ſee them oppoſed in the Perſons of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family to the reſt of the World, of <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Ham,</hi> of <hi>Lot</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and in this Text of his Church, under the Name of <hi>People of God,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as the Apoſtle oppoſes <hi>the afflictions of the people of God, unto the pleaſures of ſin in Egypt,</hi> (which <hi>Moſes</hi> might have enjoyed when called <hi>Son of Pharaoh's Daughter,</hi>) and <hi>the Reproach of Chriſt to the Treaſures in Egypt.</hi> Scripture doth in ſeveral places certifie, That <hi>Chriſt is the Head of the Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5.23.</note> but he who now is the Head of the Church was ever ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or elſe there would have been two Heads of the Church, which is as abſurd as 'tis monſtrous, to talk of a Body with two Heads: Therefore as there was a Body of the Church from the beginning of the World, ſo from that time hath Chriſt been the Head of that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and at that time he was as ſenſible of Injuries done to his Members, as we read he was after his Aſcenſion, when he from Heaven ſaid to <hi>Saul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 9.4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> that is, the Members of his Myſtical Body, for his Natural one was far enough out of his reach.</p>
            <p>Here with a ſad heart I muſt ſay, how ſince the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Aſcenſion, he never was more reproached, or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more than now; we have a Generation of Men, who with the Rebels ſpoken of in the Goſpel, ſay,<note place="margin">Luke 19.14. Pſ. 22.6.</note> 
               <hi>We will not have this man to reign over us;</hi> as much as in them lies, they would make him a <hi>reproach of men, and deſpiſed of the people,</hi> and would as the Prophet ſpeaks, make him again <hi>a man of ſorrow, acquainted with grief,</hi>

               <hi>deſpiſed and rejected of men.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> when upon Earth depriv'd him of his Life, and <hi>Socinians</hi> now when he is in Heaven, would ſtrip him of the Dignity of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that chiefly conſiſts in his Divinity, which they would rob him of; and becauſe they cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that high Myſtery, they will not believe it, ſo againſt what the Apoſtle ſaith, they walk <hi>by ſenſe not by faith;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.7.</note> Is it a reaſonable Conſequence to ſay a thing is not, becauſe they cannot comprehend it? as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am not able to know well how Bread, which hath neither Life, Heat, or Motion, can preſerve my Life and Vital Faculties, procure heat, and enable me to move, I ſhould caſt it off. They alſo attempt to reproach Chriſt in his Perſon, ſo in his Offices of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, he came to deſtroy ſin, and ſave Sinners, <hi>to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt,</hi> he came to deſtroy the Devil's Work,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.27. &amp; 9.14. 2 Cor. 5.21. Rom. 4.25. Gal. 2.20.</note> and that's Sin; this hath been the Way and Means to ſave Sinners, which was effected, as Scripture ſaith, by <hi>making himſelf an offering for ſin, by being made ſin for us, though he knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> with <hi>being deliverd for our offences,</hi> with <hi>loving us, and giving himſelf for us.</hi> Yet all this they daily ſpeak and blaſpheme againſt, as already we have abundantly demonſtrated.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed farther, to what I formerly ſaid againſt their denying that there are any Myſteries in Religion, or above the reach of human Reaſon, this I ſhall add, That there are Myſteries in the Work of Creation, as we read in the 37, 38, 39, 40, and 41 <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of <hi>Job:</hi> how many intricate and myſterious things therein, which <hi>Job,</hi> a knowing Man, and who had his Reaſon about him, could not anſwer, and calls them things <hi>too wonderful for him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 42.3.</note> 
               <hi>which he knew not.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 5.9. 'tis ſaid of God, <hi>which doth great things and unſearchable.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 9.10. <hi>which doth great things paſt finding out;</hi> yet preſumptuouſly theſe Men will be ſearching into thoſe unſearchable things, and pretend they can find thoſe things that are paſt finding out. But if there be unknown Myſteries in the Creation of the World, why then ſhould there be none of the Wiſdom of God in the Redemption of it? There are in Nature ſuch myſterious Puzlings, as can ſometimes as much ſtagger ſome Mens Faith of God's creating the World,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:30142:61"/>as that of the moſt Holy Trinity and Incarnation can ſhake the Faith of others about the Redeeming it; yet 'tis as certain, that God redeemed the World, as that he created it: And as God hath let us ſee ſo much of the Creation, as to convince us he made us of nothing, and when we were nothing; ſo in the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption he hath ſhewed us he redeemed us when we were loſt, with clear and ſufficient Evidences of his Power, Wiſdom, and Mercy: and what therein he hath revealed, we ought to believe, as our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Thomas</hi> about his Reſurrection, <hi>Be not faithleſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 20.27. Luk. 8.50.</note> 
               <hi>but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</hi> To believe, is what the Goſpel requires of us, thus Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Jairus, believe only:</hi> In Matters of Salvation, is on our part required an Obedience of Faith, for, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We walk not by ſight,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.7. Col. 2.2. &amp; 4.3.</note> or by ſenſes, <hi>but by faith.</hi> So when Scripture ſaith, <hi>We must acknowledge the myſtery of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt,</hi> we ought to believe there is ſuch a Myſtery, for ſo <hi>Paul</hi> calls it, after the Revelation of Chriſt, and of the Goſpel: and 'tis a damnable Preſumption to bring theſe Truths of God under the Scrutiny of human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſubmit them to it, and reject them when that poor, blind, corrupt, and unſound Reaſon cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them; 'tis a moſt falſe Inference to ſay, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand neither the Trinity, nor the Incarnation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no ſuch thing; as if I ſhould ſay, I cannot underſtand what God is, therefore there is no God; my Reaſon cannot underſtand the Infiniteneſs and Eternity of God, therefore God is neither Infinite nor Eternal: I do not apprehend the deſign of God's Wiſdom, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no ſuch thing in him. He permits Evil, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I cannot comprehend his Reaſon for it, muſt I blaſphemouſly ſay he is wicked? Theſe are ſuch imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Concluſions, that any Novice in the Philoſophy or Divinity Schools would hiſs out. I would hear by what Authority I may ſet up my Reaſon as Judge over that which is ſo much above it, and which I do not well know. All theſe Wanderings of Men, I ſay, can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing, except they prove their Underſtanding to be infallible and infinite. What? to fathom theſe great Depths of God with the very ſhort Line of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon? this is an intolerable Self-conceitedneſs!
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:30142:62"/>If at firſt when Watches were made, one, who never ſaw one, neither underſtood the Watch-Maker's deſign, ſeeing the ſeveral Pieces aſunder upon a Table, would have ſaid, This is of no uſe, and good for nothing; had not ſuch a one deſerv'd to be laugh'd at as a ſhallow Pate, void of good Senſe and Reaſon? Yet 'tis tranſcendently more fooliſh for any one to ſay, his Reaſon muſt judge whether what God hath revealed be true or not? O the nonſenſical, ſilly, ſhallow Brains of ſome Men! As in another place of this Diſcourſe 'tis obſerved how God ſaid that he would dwell in the <hi>thick darkneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 97.2.</note> and that <hi>clouds and darkneſs are round about him,</hi> ſo 'tis to ſhew how Men muſt not attempt to pry into't, for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the great, dark, myſterious and incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things of God.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 6.19.</note> Let the dreadful Puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon the <hi>Bethſhemites</hi> for looking into the Ark of the Lord, ſerve for a Warning to all who make themſelves guilty of the like Attempts. 'Tis alſo faid, That <hi>God dwelleth in the light which no man can approach unto:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.16.</note> which tends to keep men from meddling too far, and preſumptuouſly attempting to look into the ſecret and glorious things of God, beyond what he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. But <hi>Socinians</hi> pretend to be clear-ſighted enough to ſee through that thick darkneſs, and to be ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted enough, with the Eye of their humane Reaſon, ſtedfaſtly to look on the Infinite, Glorious and Unacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Majeſty of God, and as it were to ſtare him in the face; but they ſhould know, how in this ſenſe <hi>no man ſhall ſee his face, and live.</hi> After this rate, theſe all-knowing Men may happen to attempt giving a Deſcription of Heaven, which according to their Principles, is a thing not above their Reaſon to do, or beyond the reach of their Capacity; ſo no Myſtery to them. Thus they ſhall go beyond <hi>Paul,</hi> and know more than he, who though he was caught up to the <hi>third heaven</hi> into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, yet ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>whether in the body or out of the body, I cannot tell,</hi> and there <hi>he heard unſpeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter:</hi> We would deſire <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> whom, as they ſay, nothing in Religion is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery unto, and who think their Reaſon can and may know that which others ſay they neither can nor may know, becauſe they are Myſteries: I ſay we would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:30142:62"/>them to give the World an account of what that Paradiſe is, and what are the unſpeakable words which <hi>Paul</hi> hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> there, and which it was not lawful for ſuch a Man as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to utter.</p>
            <p>But once for all, to come to the <hi>Jugulum Cauſae,</hi> to the very heart of the point: in all Matters' of Religion, we muſt have a fixed Law and Rule to be guided and judg'd by, which Rule muſt be backt by an infallible or Divine Authority to ſtand to, which is our Caſe againſt Papiſts, who would have the Authority or the Reaſon of the Church to be that ſame Rule, as <hi>Socinians</hi> more unreaſonably, would have every private Man's Reaſon to be it, which as occaſion ſhall ſerve, can by Fancy or Intereſt, under the name of Reaſon, be wreſted and by aſſed, ſo, that Reaſon ſo apt to be blinded and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon, cannot be the Law; for there is no reaſon why one Man ſhould be guided and directed by the Opinion of another, if he hath no Commiſſion from God proved by Miracles: for the wiſeſt of Men may happen to be blinded by Ignorance, as the beſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by Intereſt and Luſt. After this, Men will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtand to any thing, but will quickly run into thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Confuſion, Superſtition, and Idolatry, both in reſpect of God, and of his Worſhip. Without a true Divine Rule, and that's only God's Word, no certainty of the true Knowledge of God, and of his Worſhip, for all the Precepts of Nature are doubtful and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; for they muſt be drawn from long Obſervations of Nature it ſelf, great ſtrength of Reaſoning, deep ſkill in Philoſophy, and ſo many other dependencies and circumſtances, that 'tis almoſt impoſſible to find a Man endow'd with all ſuch neceſſary Qualifications. So then to depend upon one's natural Reaſon as a Guide to Salvation, is to truſt upon a bruiſed Reed, on which if a Man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it; but if we truſt in God's Word, which is the Word of Truth, the Holy Ghoſt will thereby, in order to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, make all ſafe and ſure to us, whilſt he leaves thoſe who abound in their own ſenſe, to do ſo ſtill, and thoſe who will not underſtand what they will not believe, to continue in their Ignorance, Unbelief, and Wilfulneſs; as for us, Scripture is our Rule.</p>
            <pb n="116" facs="tcp:30142:63"/>
            <p>Now Scripture ſpeaks of the Son of God long before his Incarnation, as of a Perſon Acting, Puniſhing, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering, &amp;c. an unanſwerable proof that he then Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or elſe he would not have acted, for <hi>Modum eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di ſequitur modus operandi;</hi> none can Act except he be, which, as obſerved, could not be in his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Now in the Word of God we read no ſuch thing of the greateſt and beſt Men, as <hi>Moſes, Elias, John Baptiſt,</hi> no mention at all of them, till after their Birth, only <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s was foretold, not long before, but not a word of any thing he did before he was Born,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.4.9.</note> as we read of Chriſt, that, <hi>He was the Rock that follow'd the People</hi> in the Wilderneſs; that <hi>he was tempted by them,</hi> &amp;c.

If the Son knows the Father only in part, then the Father knows the Son but in part, which to aſſert, is Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but if the Father knows the Son perfectly, ſo the Son alſo knows the Father perfectly; and as no finite Creature can perfectly know the infinite God, ſo he that perfectly knows the infinite God, muſt himſelf be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite God, ſuch is the Lord Jeſus his own Son: When <hi>Thomas</hi> anſwered,<note place="margin">Jo. 20.28.</note> 
               <hi>My Lord, and my God,</hi> he anſwer'd him who ſpake to him, that is Chriſt, ſo then <hi>Thomas</hi> owned him for his Lord, and his God; he knew out of the Law, and by what Chriſt had taught him, that there is but one God,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.2. and 9.18. and 14.33. and 15.25. and 20.20. and 28.17.</note> therefore he would not have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him his God, and worſhipped him as ſuch, if he had not believed him to be the true God of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> To this, I ſhall add, that our Saviour, who was no Friend to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, ſuffered himſelf at ſeveral times, as may be ſeen in the Margin, to be Religiouſly worſhipped, that is, as God, and never hindred any from it; but if he had not been God, he would never have permitted any one to worſhip him as ſuch.</p>
            <p>So under the ſhape of a Man he had been by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> very long before;<note place="margin">Gen. 18.1.</note> for we read how the Lord or <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah appeared to him in the plains of Mamre,</hi> in ver. 1. 'tis poſitively ſaid, <hi>Jehovah,</hi> but in 2, we read <hi>three men ſtood by him,</hi> whereof one was the Lord, attended by two Angels, at which ſight, that Father of Believers <hi>bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf towards the ground,</hi> and addreſſed his Speech only to one, <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if I have found favour in thy ſight,</hi> &amp;c. and by the Diſcourſe that afterwards hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, it plainly appears the ſame was the true Eternal God, who promiſed <hi>Sarah</hi> ſhould have a Son, this is the ſame, who in the Chap. before had appeared unto him, made a Covenant with him, appointed Circumciſion for the Seal of it, and alſo had at that time promiſed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:30142:64"/>
               <hi>Sarah</hi> ſhould have a Son, and there he called himſelf <hi>the Almighty God;</hi> without queſtion,<note place="margin">chap. 17.1.</note> this was the true God by Nature, for none is Almighty, but he, who if ſuch, for the words are convertible Almighty and True, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally eternal God, he who is the one is the other too: Now 'tis very obſervable, how he who in the firſt Book of the Old Teſtament proclaim'd himſelf <hi>the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi> doth in the laſt of the New, declare himſelf to be <hi>the Almighty,</hi> and as there is but one Almighty;<note place="margin">Rev. 1.8.</note> ſo in theſe two ſeveral places 'tis but one and the ſame that ſpeaks. Now <hi>John</hi> ſaith it plainly enough, that the Lord Jeſus is the Almighty, as in another place I heretofore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evidenced, which to ſtrengthen, this I ſhall add that as Chriſt our Lord in the 1 Chap. of that Book, calls himſelf Simply and abſolutely, the Almighty; ſo towards the latter end of the ſame,<note place="margin">chap. 16.14.</note> he is called <hi>God Almighty,</hi> and that this is ſpoken of him, the beginning of the verſe clears it, when it ſaith, <hi>They are the ſpirits of devils, which go forth unto the kings of the earth to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</hi> For a greater Confirmation, let this be compared with another Chapter,<note place="margin">chap. 19. from ver. 11, to the end.</note> wherein mention is made of that Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and its Succeſs, there is as true a Deſcription of Chriſt in the Perſon of the General of the Army, as can be; he is called, <hi>faithful and true, and in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs he doth judge and make war, his eyes were as a flame of fire,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>his name is called the word of God;</hi> and lower, <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> and <hi>the great God.</hi> If after theſe poſitive, plain and full Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, the Lord Jeſus be not the true, eſſential Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, then there is no truth in Scripture, whoſe main deſign is to declare him to be the Son of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, who from Heaven, and out of the Father's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom came into the World to ſave us from Sin, Death, and Hell.</p>
            <p>Of this, the Deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> was a Type, and both Deliverances have one and the ſame Author. I find much to our purpoſe contained in that place, where the Prophet ſpeaking of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaith of God, <hi>He was their Saviour, in all their affliction he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,</hi>

               <hi>and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them, in his love and in his pity he redeemed them.</hi> Which place ſeems to relate to what the Lord ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> out of the midſt of the

               <hi>I have ſurely ſeen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt;</hi> which is as if in the manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men, he had ſaid, I have ſeen and conſidered of my Peoples Affliction, and for it have pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on them: It is obſervable, how he who in that place appeared unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> is there called by ſeveral Names; firſt, <hi>The angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire,</hi> ver. 2. and in the <hi>fourth</hi> he is called both <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>God, When the Lord ſaw that he turned aſide to ſee, God called unto him.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 6. he is again called <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 7. the <hi>Lord.</hi> Under theſe ſeveral Names of Angel of the Lord, God and the Lord, in the different things by him ſpoken, is deſigned the true God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> which I here take notice of, becauſe it being compared with this Text of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> we now are upon, it helps toward a better undeſtanding thereof: Here 'tis ſaid of the true God, <hi>he was their Saviour,</hi> then 'tis added, <hi>the Angel of his preſence ſaved them;</hi> both theſe are abſolutely expreſſed, and abſolutely there can be but one Saviour, who is God, ſo the Angel who ſaved them muſt needs be God, and 'tis to be taken notice of, how he who here is called the <hi>Angel of his preſence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 33.14.</note> is elſewhere called <hi>God's preſence, my preſence ſhall go with thee;</hi> to ſhew how God's Preſence, and the Angel of his Preſence, is one and the ſame God: and he who led the People through the Wilderneſs, is in another place alſo called Angel,<note place="margin">

               <hi>I ſend an Angel before thee,</hi> but ſuch a one as <hi>his name was in him;</hi> that is, All I have revealed of my ſelf is in him: and this very ſame who ſaved them, is in the ſame Verſe ſaid <hi>to have redeemed them..</hi> Can any one deny the Names Saviour and Redeemer properly and perſonally to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, who from the very firſt verſe of the Chapter is pointed at, and in <hi>ver.</hi> 7. the Prophet ſaith of him, <hi>I will mention the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſſes of the Lord, and the praiſes of the Lord, who bare them and carried them,</hi> his people, <hi>all the days of old,</hi> in the Wilderneſs; ſurely he who had done all theſe great things for them, was their God, <hi>ſo didſt thou lead thy people, to make thy ſelf a glorious and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting name,</hi> v. 12, 14.

Now our Saviour's reaſon to forbid them, is this, the Devil is known to be a Lyar, and a truth out of a Lyar's mouth is ſuſpected; therefore to hinder its being queſtioned, he ſuffered them not to ſpeak it, for he knew how ready his Enemies would be to take all advantage againſt him, for they ſaid, <hi>He caſteth out Devils by Beelzebub the prince of the Devils,</hi> which he did as God, and by his own Divine Power; but the LXX. ſaid, <hi>the Devils are ſubject to us through thy name.</hi> Luke 10.17.</p>
            <p>This truth can be found out no better than with comparing Scripture with Scripture, in order to't, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repeating what I ſaid before of the Angel promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to go before the People in the Wilderneſs, whom God called <hi>his preſence;</hi> I ſhall proceed to new matter,<note place="margin">Exod. 23.</note> and take notice how that very ſame, who went before the People, and was called Angel, if we may believe <hi>David,</hi> was <hi>God, the God of Iſrael,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Zech. 9.9.</note> which, when the thing mention'd was actually done to the Lord Jeſus, the Evangeliſt applies it as ſpoken of him by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.

            <p>So do many things more, variouſly and abundantly, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Prophets,<note place="margin">Iſai. 8.13.14.</note> as among others is this, <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Lord of Hoſts himſelf; let him be your fear, and let him be your dread:</hi> And to move them to't, he gives this reaſon, &amp;c. <hi>He ſhall be for a ſanctuary</hi> to thoſe that ſanctifie him, and whoſe fear he is, but to Tranſgreſſours and Diſobedient; <hi>to both houſes of Iſrael he ſhall be for a ſtone of ſtumbling, and rock of offence, for a gin and for a ſnare to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem.</hi> This Prophecy is of Chriſt in both parts, firſt a Sanctuary to thoſe who fear him, and preſent help and Relief ſuitable to their wants,<note place="margin">Joh. 7.37. chap. 6.35.</note> therefore he crieth and ſaith, <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink, for he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thirſt:</hi>

The Lord of Hoſts himſelf is certainly the true eternal God; but Chriſt, if we may believe an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, and two Apoſtles, is that Lord of Hoſts himſelf,<note place="margin">Iſa. 43.10.</note> of whom thoſe things were foretold: This one thing more I ſhall add, how <hi>Socinians</hi> with making Chriſt a Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical God, give God himſelf the Lye, who by the ſame Prophet ſaith, <hi>Before me there was no God formed, neither ſhall there be after me,</hi> for according to them, Chriſt was a formed and made God ſeveral Hundreds of Years after God had ſaid ſo.</p>
            <p>But to convince them of their abominable Errour, I ſhall bring in the Evidence of ſome of their good Friends, the <hi>Jews</hi> I mean: The <hi>Jews,</hi> ſpecially the Maſters of the firſt and true <hi>Cabbala,</hi> do very often mention <hi>Schechina,</hi> whereby they mean the <hi>Meſſiah, Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh,</hi> the Son of God, who from the beginning of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, to the deſtruction of the firſt Temple, in a clear and illuſtrious manner dwelt with thoſe that were pious: Hence it is that they made Light created on the firſt day,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.14 Heb. 9.9.23. 1 Cor. 10.6.11.

            <p>To proceed further into this Matter, which I hope to make a good uſe of in this Cauſe; I ſay, how the Son of God, immediately after <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, as being the Judge of the whole Earth, to exert his judicial Power, called him to an account for his Sin, when to him he ſaid, <hi>Where art thou?</hi> As if he had ſaid, What haſt thou done?

            <p>All this I brought in, to ſhew how, according to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Antient Jews, the <hi>Schechina,</hi> or Meniah was the Son of God, had a Being, and acted from the beginning, not of the Goſpel, but of the World, and thus in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head they made a diſtinction of Perſons: And if <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> will own the Lord Jeſus to be the Chriſt, then either with the antient Jews they muſt own him to have been and acted from the beginning of the Creation, and ſo to have had a Being long before his Birth of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, or elſe they muſt joyn with the Modern Jews, deny him to be the Meſſiah, and thus proclaim themſelves to be no Chriſtians, nay Idolaters, and ſuch as neither know, nor worſhip the true God, for he that owns not and worſhippeth not Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, doth not own nor worſhip the true God, but they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny the Holy Ghoſt, and in effect, deny the Son, which is very hard, and unworthy. Becauſe the Son of God for our ſake was pleaſed to take upon him our Humane Nature, ſome Men unthankfully and impiouſly go about to ſtrip him of his Divine: On our behalf he humbled himſelf, and for that, ſome Men undervalue him, as if their Eye was Evil becauſe he is good.</p>
            <p>We reckon ſeveral Ages of the Church, whereof every one affords Demonſtrations of the Son of God, her Head's Preſence and Actings for her: The firſt is of her Birth and Childhood from the Creation to the Flood; the

               <note place="margin">Ezr. 5.1, 2.</note> returned from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, to build the ſecond Temple, which was to ſtand till the coming of the Lord of Hoſts,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:30142:72"/>and King of <hi>Zion,</hi> as this Prophet calls him, <hi>chap.</hi> 9.9. As alſo did <hi>Haggai</hi> the other Prophet, who beſides, named him the deſire of all Nations;<note place="margin">Hag. 2.7.</note> 
               <hi>And I will ſhake all Nations, and the deſire of all Nations ſhall come; And I will fill this Houſe with glory, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts;</hi> that is, the Preſence of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> Son of God, was to fill with Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the ſecond Temple, which at that time they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout building; upon which account the glory of that lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Houſe was to be greater than that of the former; the Lord Jeſus, who called it his Houſe, having with his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence often ſanctified it, and been the chief glory thereof, which ſoon after it loſt by his Death, when the Vail of the Temple was rent, and about forty Years after the whole was quite deſtroyed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> when according to our Bleſſed Saviour's Prophecy, there was not one Stone left upon another that was not thrown down; and what he ſaid was attended with a Character and Evidence of his Divine Authority, and infallible Truth, in theſe Words,<note place="margin">Matth. 24.35.</note> 
               <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but my Words ſhall not paſs away,</hi> but moſt certainly ſhall be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>This ſame Prophet in the next Chapter, (as indeed in many other places of his Viſion) doth yield Matter enough upon this point; As in <hi>Job</hi> we read of Satan coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God with malicious Inſinuations againſt that Holy Man, and to obtain leave to do him miſchief; ſo here we find the Angel of the Lord to judge between <hi>Joſhua</hi> the High-prieſt, and his Adverſary Satan, who appeared there to oppoſe and reſiſt him: This Angel of the Lord, whom elſewhere I at ſeveral times have had occaſion to ſpeak of, is the Lord himſelf; for in the 2d verſe 'tis ſaid, <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Satan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zech. 3.1, 2</note> 
               <hi>the Lord rebuke thee, O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan:</hi> Twice <hi>the Lord</hi> anſwers this other Expreſſion, <hi>And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 9.24.</note> 
               <hi>Brimſtone and Fire from the Lord;</hi> and certainly 'tis ſpoken of the ſame two Perſons whom the Name Lord belongs to: The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Perſon is but one, but the Father's and Son's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are two Perſons, yet but one <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or Lord, with this difference; That as the Father hath committed all Judgment to the Son, ſo the Son doth Adminiſter and Execute all Judgment in the World, commanding and making uſe of this Authority, ſometimes under the Name of the Angel, before whom ſtood <hi>Joſhua</hi> cloathed with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:30142:72"/>filthy Garments: Now, that this Angel was really and truly God, it appears by his commanding of his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s filthy Garments to be taken away from him, and by his ſaying to him, <hi>Behold I have cauſed thine Iniquity to paſs from thee,</hi> which none but the true God can ſay or do; for none can forgive ſins but <hi>God</hi> alone, which is a Phraſe equivalent to this, I have cauſed thine Iniquity to paſs from thee; this more and more appears out of what is contained in verſes 6, and 7. <hi>And the Angel of the Lord proteſted unto Joſhua, thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou ſhalt alſo judge my Houſe, and ſhalt alſo keep my Courts.</hi> Who but the true <hi>God</hi> can ſpeak af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner? And that no ground ſhould be left to doubt of this Truth, that ſame Angel calls himſelf the Lord of Hoſts; for the Angel of the Lord proteſted, ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts; as if he had ſaid, I who am the Lord of Hoſts, proteſt unto thee, If thou wilt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then I promiſe thee ſo and ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is the proper ſtyle of him who abſolutely is Lord and Maſter of all. Hence we may learn another thing, which is, that <hi>Joſhua</hi> being the High-prieſt, was a Type of Jeſus Chriſt our High-prieſt, in things pertaining to Salvation; <hi>who,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>His own ſelf bare our ſins,</hi> which are the filthy garments ſpoken of by the Prophet, <hi>in his Body,</hi> 1 Pet. 2, 24. and which by his Death having made a full Atonement for, he was cloathed with change of Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or with his own Righteouſneſs;<note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> 
               <hi>And when he had by himſelf purged our ſins, ſat down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But farther, to prove his Divinity, here I ſhall bring in two Arguments, which no where elſe I made uſe of before: The firſt is this, All men (that is, meerly men and no more than men) are Sinners, but Chriſt is no Sinner, therefore Chriſt is no meer man, but more than a man. According to Rules this Argument is in <hi>Mode</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> and both of theſe Propoſitions can fully and unanſwerably be proved out of God's Word: As to the <hi>Major,</hi> 'tis made good in two ways; <hi>firſt,</hi> by poſitive Aſſertions; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> by Examples. The firſt hath two Branches, whereof <hi>one</hi> is, That every man is originally a ſinner by nature; for human Nature is ſinful and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt: the <hi>other</hi> is, That every man is an actual ſinner;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:30142:73"/>for as ſaid before, as at firſt the Perſon infected the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo ſince, the Nature hath infected the Perſons for <hi>by one man ſin entered into the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.12.24.</note> 
               <hi>and death by ſin and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned</hi> though not every one <hi>after the ſimilitude of Adam's tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion:</hi> and when <hi>David</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 5.3.</note> 
               <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me,</hi> he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it of all men, as well as of himſelf, for without any difference or exception,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.3</note> 
               <hi>we are all children of wrath, even as others.</hi> As for the other part, That every man is an actual ſinner,<note place="margin">1 Kings 8.46. Jam. 3.2.</note> 'tis plain, for <hi>there is no man that ſinneth not;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>All have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God;</hi> and another Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>In many things we offend all;</hi> wherefore in Scripture ſometimes men are call'd by the <hi>Epithet</hi> of ſinners and ſinful.</p>
            <p>But in Scripture the Holy Ghoſt is not ſatisfied to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm every man to be a ſinner, but he therein gives In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of, and mentions the ſins of the beſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Servants of God. <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin I ſhall not name, which whole Mankind has cauſe to remember with a witneſs; but I ſhall take notice of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Drunkenneſs,<note place="margin">Gen. 9.21. chap. 19. chap. 12. and 20. chap. 26. chap. 43.15. Gen. 45.13 Exod. 4. Pſ. 106.33 James 5. Act. 15.39</note> of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Drunkenneſs and Inceſt, of the Miſtruſt and Diſſembling of <hi>Abraham,</hi> twice the like of <hi>Iſaac;</hi> of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſwear by the Life of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> with ſomething of vanity in him when he ſaid to his Brethren, <hi>You ſhall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt;</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorineſs to obey God, when he commanded him to go to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his Unadviſedneſs: ſo <hi>Job</hi>'s Impatience, <hi>David</hi>'s Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Murther, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Idolatry; and that zealous Servant of God, <hi>Elias,</hi> was ſubject to like Paſſions as we are; ſo <hi>Peter</hi>'s Denyal, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> Falling out about no great Matter: In few words, every Servant of God had their Flaws, and therefore in a way of defiance <hi>Solomon</hi> asketh,<note place="margin">Prov. 20.9</note> 
               <hi>Who can ſay, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my ſin?</hi> Now, I unqueſtionably proved every man to be a ſinner.</p>
            <p>Now muſt I prove the <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, That the Lord Jeſus is no ſinner; which to do is an eaſie task. He never was nor is a ſinner, for though he aſſumed our human ſinful Nature, yet by the immediate working of the Holy Ghoſt, which ſanctified that part of the Subſtance of the Virgin, out of which
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:30142:73"/>was form'd our Saviour's Body, it was preſerved from natural corruption, wherefore the Apoſtle calls him,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.26.</note> 
               <hi>holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners:</hi> And as he ever was free from Original, ſo he never committed any Actual ſin, which made him defie the Jews thus,<note place="margin">Joh. 8.46. Heb. 4.15.</note> 
               <hi>Which of you convinceth me of ſin?</hi> None could; for though <hi>he was in all points tempted like as we are, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.19</note> therefore the Apoſtle calls him <hi>a Lamb with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh and without ſpot:</hi> and in the next Chapter he adds, <hi>who did no ſin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">chap. 2.22. 1 Joh. 3.5.</note> 
               <hi>neither was guile found in his mouth;</hi> and <hi>in him was no ſin,</hi> ſaith another Apoſtle, which Truth I look upon as undeniably proved: And ſo from the Premiſes I may well conclude, That ſeeing the Lord Jeſus is a Man, yet not a ſinner, he muſt needs be no meer Man, but more than a Man, and ſo God and Man; if he had been a meer Man. <hi>ut ſic, reduplicative,</hi> he alſo had been a ſinner, but ſeeing he is not a ſinner, then he is not a meer Man: In this caſe, any conſideration drawn from Angels is not pertinent, for the queſtion is only of Divine and Humane Nature, not of the Angelical, for <hi>He took not on him the nature of Angels,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2.16.</note> 
               <hi>but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The following Argument is alſo in <hi>mode</hi> and <hi>figure,</hi> 'tis thus; all Goodneſs is Eſſentially in God alone, but Jeſus Chriſt is Eſſentially good, therefore he is Eſſentially God: The <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition I thus explain, by Eſſentially, is meant Primarily, Originally, and in its Nature, God is Independently ſole good, in and of himſelf, and is the Author of all Goodneſs. <hi>Metaphyſicians</hi> among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties <hi>entis,</hi> of a Being, which by a Virtual Recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration do reſult from, and are converted with the <hi>ens,</hi> or being, reckon three, by them called <hi>Incomplexe,</hi> or ſpoken without disjunction to diſtiguiſh them from the <hi>Complexe</hi> which are attended with a disjunction: The three are <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num,</hi> one, which implies a Negation of a Diviſion, for <hi>ens,</hi> when multiplied ceaſes to be one: <hi>Verum,</hi> true, is the ſecond, which imports a relation to the Mind, as <hi>Bonum,</hi> good, which is the third, doth to the Will: Now if according to this, every created Being is one, true, and good in its ſelf, how much more tranſcendent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt it be ſo with the <hi>ens entium,</hi> Being of Beings, as the Philoſopher calls the firſt Cauſe of all, that is, God infinite, who is Eſſentially One, True, and Good.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:30142:74"/>But becauſe the queſtion is now about the laſt, and that Goodneſs of his is ſo fully and univerſally known, in this place I ſhall ſay no more to demonſtrate it.</p>
            <p>Therefore I come to the proof of my <hi>Major,</hi> namely, That all Goodneſs is Eſſentially in God alone; and to be ſhort, out of ſo many Texts of Scripture I ſhall bring but one, which is home, and to the purpoſe; the words are our Saviour's,<note place="margin">Matth. 19.17.</note> 
               <hi>There is none good but one, that is God,</hi> Eſſentially and abſolutely meant, what goodneſs there is in the Creature being all derived from him: This I take for granted, and ſo come to prove my <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,</hi> how Chriſt is Eſſentially Good.</p>
            <p>If <hi>all things that the Father hath be his,</hi> as he ſaith, they are, then certainly, that Divine Attribute, Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Goodneſs, is included, and as he hath the Nature, ſo the inſeparable Attribute of that Nature, <hi>&amp; è con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſo,</hi> if the Attribute, then the Nature: Of Divine Goodneſs there are two Proprieties, one, that it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive and communicative of it ſelf; the other, that 'tis moſt deſirable. In two ways God doth communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Goodneſs, firſt inwardly, which Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is natural and neceſſary, whereby God the Father hath from all Eternity by Generation communicated his Nature and manner of Subſiſting unto his Son, and both to the Holy Ghoſt, by ſpiration: The Second way is Free and Voluntary, whereby God hath communicated his Goodneſs unto his Creatures, which makes <hi>David</hi> to ſay,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.68. Acts 10.38.</note> 
               <hi>Thou art good and doeſt good.</hi> Thus <hi>Peter</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves about our Saviour that <hi>he went about doing good.</hi> Now this Goodneſs of God, hath in ſeveral ways been communicated to his Creatures, as in the Creation and Preſervation of the World, in the work of Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Adoption, and Eternal Happineſs, in every one of which relating to Salvation, our Saviour hath been an Efficient and Meritorious Cauſe, and hath together with the Father, communicated his Natural Divine Goodneſs in theſe ſeveral branches, or kinds thereof; firſt in <hi>Grace,</hi> whereby God in himſelf is altogether love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therein doth favour and benefit his Creatures. The ſecond is <hi>Love,</hi> whereby God takes pleaſure in what he likes, doth it good, and unites it unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; this love the word ſpeaks of,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.16.</note> when it ſaith, <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:30142:74"/>And doth not Scripture ſay alſo, that his Son,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.25. Epheſ. 3.19. Jo. 15.13. 1 Joh. 4.8.</note> 
               <hi>gave himſelf for us?</hi> and this love of his for us, is ſo great that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It paſſeth all knowledge,</hi> and <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi> In few words, <hi>God is love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, <hi>Mercifulneſs</hi> is another branch of God's Goodneſs exalted in ſo many places of Scripture, that I take it to be unneceſſary to inſiſt upon't. And was not Chriſt all along full of tender Mercies and Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards poor ſinners, which among his own unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Nation got him the Name of a Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate and merciful Nature, and all the <hi>rich Graces</hi> of the Father as <hi>Paul</hi> calls them, are conveyed to us in, by, and with Chriſt. <hi>Lastly,</hi> God's <hi>Patience,</hi> is another part of his Goodneſs, which is highly commended in Scripture; and, O the wonderful Meekneſs, Forbearance and Patience of Chriſt, who by the Preaching of his Goſpel, doth invite ſinners to Repentance, and as it were, doth beſeech them to be reconciled unto God, and though by too many he be ſlighted and rejected, yet he ſtill waiteth: That ſame in ſeveral places of Scripture, is the Character given of him, and in part, for that Meekneſs, Gentleneſs and Patience, he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Lamb.</p>
            <p>But to come to the <hi>ſecond</hi> Attribute of Goodneſs, 'tis what in its Nature is <hi>appetibile,</hi> deſirable, or what all deſire: We know the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> the ſupreme good is <hi>Summoperè appetibile,</hi> Supremely deſirable; but can any in Heaven or Earth, be more deſirable than the Lord Jeſus, who, is <hi>the chiefeſt among ten thouſand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Songs 5.10 ver. 16. Hagg. 2.7.</note> and <hi>altogether lovely,</hi> called <hi>the deſire of all Nations.</hi> This demonſtrates him Eſſentially to have in him that Divine Goodneſs, which is inherent to, and inſeparable from Divine Nature, and conſequently to be Eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God.</p>
            <p>Before I leave off this, I muſt anſwer an Objection, which might happen to be made againſt this great Truth of Chriſt's being eſſentially good; 'tis drawn out of the ſame Chapter which already I have made uſe of, wherein the Lord ſpeaks to one who came to him for Counſel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Salvation, and by him, as a Prophet, to be taught the way to Heaven: <hi>Good Maſter,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>What good thing ſhall I do, that I may have Eternal Life?</hi> The firſt part of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:30142:75"/>our Saviour's Anſwer was, <hi>Why callest thou me good?</hi> As if he diſproved his calling him ſo; but that was not the Lord's Meaning, who denies not himſelf to be good; for he ſaith not, I am not good, or thou art miſtaken to call me ſo; but he lays hold upon that occaſion, to teach the Man that he is God: As if he had ſaid, Thou owneſt me to be good, and ſo I am; but that's not enough, thou muſt alſo believe me to be God, becauſe <hi>there is none good but one, that is God;</hi> the meaning is eſſentially good, and of himſelf; and ſeeing in that ſenſe Chriſt is good, he muſt needs be God, and that's the ſame Argument which here I proſecute; thus it runneth, Thou ſhouldeſt not call me good, except alſo thou be perſwaded that I am God: Theſe two Propoſitions are convertible, God is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially good, and he who is eſſentially good, is God: So if in that ſenſe Chriſt be good, then he is God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hammer</hi> of the Word,<note place="margin">Jer. 23.29.</note> (for ſo 'tis call'd) will help to ſtrike the Nail farther into the Head of thoſe proud and unchriſtian <hi>Siſera's,</hi> Unbelievers I may alſo call them, ſeeing they refuſe to believe the true God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when he ſpeaks of his Son, who under the Name of this Angel, he promiſed ſhould go before them;<note place="margin">Ex. 32.34.</note> 
               <hi>Mine Angel ſhall go before thee:</hi> And in the next Chapter God calls him <hi>his Preſence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ch. 33.14.</note> or his Face; God hath many Angels, but in a moſt ſpecial manner, that he calls his, but God hath not many Faces,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6.</note> only one, and that is <hi>the Face of Jeſus Chriſt, in whom</hi> only <hi>is the knowledge of the glory of God;</hi> for God giveth the knowledge of his glory only in him, <hi>Becauſe he is the expreſs Image of his,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> the Father's <hi>Perſon:</hi> Thoſe two Texts in the Old Teſtament compared with, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by theſe two in the New, ſhew that the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the proper Son of God, went before, and guided his People in the Wilderneſs, ſo pre-exiſted the time of his Birth of the Virgin, and that it may not be ſaid of any Creature, that the glory of God is in his Face, or that he is the expreſs Image of the Perſon of the Father, and the <hi>brightneſs of his glory,</hi> as the Beam is the brightneſs of the glory of the Sun.</p>
            <p>In my way towards a Concluſion, I ſhall by the grace of God briefly bring in ſome few Texts, which do explain and confirm the great Truths now in queſtion; ſome I elſewhere have taken notice of, however I now ſhall add
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:30142:75"/>ſomething to what I then ſaid, but others I ſhall mention which I did not before, but this I ſhall premiſe.</p>
            <p>In the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi>'s Days, who lived to a very Old Age, ſprang up ſome Hereſiarks, as <hi>Simon</hi> the firſt of all, <hi>Cerinthus, Ebion,</hi> and <hi>Menander,</hi> who deny'd the Divinity of Chriſt, as now <hi>Socinians</hi> do. This moved the Apoſtle to aſſert and vindicate it, as in his Goſpel, Epiſtles, and Revelation he hath done ſo fully, that if there were no other Books left of the New Teſtament, there is in them abundantly enough to certifie and confirm that Heavenly Truth, as out of ſeveral places in his Writings, I ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently demonſtrated in my Book againſt the Blaſphemies of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> which he doth ſo plainly, and ſo often, that we muſt take notice how the Holy Ghoſt, by his Pen, intended chiefly and ſtrongly to ſuggeſt to and convince Men of the Fundamental Truth of Chriſtian Religion; namely, that the Lord Jeſus is the proper Son of God;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.5.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 20.</note> and to the end that great Truth may make a deep impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the Souls of Men; in one Chapter, in no leſs than ſeven Verſes, he emphatically calls him the Son of God; and <hi>v.</hi> 10, he is twice ſo called, ſo twice in the 13th. and that in ſuch a manner, ſo ſenſibly and with ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as denote a true, proper, and natural kind of Son-ſhip; and he is ſo earneſt upon't, (may be all that time having in his Eye the Blaſphemy of thoſe Hereticks) as to charge thoſe who deny Chriſt to be the Son of <hi>God,</hi> and believe not in him, to make <hi>God</hi> a Lyar, who is the <hi>God</hi> of Truth, the higheſt Blaſphemy that the Devil can infuſe into Men: <hi>For,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he that believeth on the Son of God, hath the Witneſs in himſelf, he that believeth not God, hath made him a Lyar:</hi> He ſaith, wherein? <hi>Becauſe he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son:</hi> And what is that Record? Beſides his Commiſſion in ſending him into the World, and <hi>the Works</hi> attended with ſo many Miracles and Wonders, <hi>which the Father gave him to finiſh;</hi> and to the evidence of which our Saviour did appeal, we have it in his Baptiſm in a moſt eminent and ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for the Father bare record of him, when he ſaid from Heaven, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Certainly <hi>God</hi> ſpoke abſolutely, truly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and not Metaphorically, improperly, and by a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; not my Son according to the Fleſh, ſpiritually or only in ſome reſpect, but ſimply, my Son; that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:30142:76"/>of my ſubſtance, and of the ſame Nature with me, as a Son ought to be, and is of the ſame Nature with the Father,<note place="margin">

But I muſt go on.</p>
            <p>The Centurion's Words are remarkable, when he ſaid to our Saviour,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.8</note> 
               <hi>Lord, ſpeak the Word only, and my Servant ſhall be healed;</hi> juſt as Scripture ſpeaks in the matter of Creation,<note place="margin">Pſal. 33.9.</note> 
               <hi>He ſpake and it was done, he commanded and it ſtood:</hi> Such a Word of Command we read of in <hi>Jonah, And the Lord ſpake unto the Fiſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jonah 2.10</note> 
               <hi>and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry Land;</hi> which laſt words imply a ſpecial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ordering of things; for the Fiſh might have
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:30142:76"/>vomited him in the middle, or the bottom of the Sea; but becauſe God would ſave him, 'twas upon dry Land. But to return to the Centurion, whoſe great Faith the Lord commended, he believed and was not miſtaken, that our Saviour might as abſolutely command Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Health, Death and Life, as he commanded his own Soldiers and Servants; for we read in ſeveral places, how the Lord Jeſus with ſpeaking the Word to Diſeaſes, Winds, and to Devils, he rebuked them ſo, that they could do no otherwiſe but to obey, which proves his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, and ſo his Divine Nature, for none but God hath a Divine Power: Upon this ground, after the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Work of curing the Impotent Man, who had been ſick 38 Years, there our Lord compares his miraculous Works to his Father's, when he ſaid,<note place="margin">John 5.</note> 
               <hi>My Father works hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and I work:</hi> The word <hi>my</hi> in the place is very em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical to ſhew that his Works and the Father's were wrought by the ſame Divine and Infinite power, which meaning they underſtood well enough; whence upon good grounds they concluded, <hi>he had ſaid God was his Father,</hi> in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe, <hi>and made himſelf equal with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In another place we read of ſome of the ten Men that were Lepers, whom the Lord Jeſus had cured,<note place="margin">Luk. 17.15</note> who <hi>when he ſaw that he was healed, returned back, and with a loud voice glorified God;</hi> he turned back to Chriſt the great Phyſician, to give him Thanks and Praiſes,<note place="margin">v. 16.</note> and worſhip him upon his Knees; for we muſt look upon him in that poſture, ſince our Saviour told him, <hi>Ariſe, go thy way:</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 19.</note> And by that Act he paid him a Divine Honour, and by comparing <hi>v.</hi> 18. with <hi>v.</hi> 15. we ſhall find Chriſt to be the God whom the Man glorified; for the Evangeliſt's, and the Lord's Words are the ſame, tend to the ſame purpoſe, and the Object of the Glory given, is the ſame. <hi>There are not found,</hi> ſaid the Lord, <hi>that returned to give glory to God,</hi> that is, to me who healed them, <hi>ſave this ſtranger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther to go on upon the matter, let us obſerve how the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſt by his Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſaith, <hi>We have a great High-priest that is past into the Heavens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 4.14.</note> 
               <hi>Jeſus the Son of God:</hi> The laſt words are put in to give us a proper and diſtinguiſhing Character of the Perſon whom he ſpeaks of, as indeed in the place this is added to make
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:30142:77"/>a difference between Jeſus Chriſt our Bleſſed Saviour, and the <hi>Jeſus</hi> he had nam'd before,<note place="margin">v. 8.</note> whereby he meaned <hi>Joſhua</hi> for in <hi>Greek</hi> 'tis the ſame as <hi>Joſhua</hi> in <hi>Hebrew;</hi> and here we ſee plainly how the Name Son of God, proper to Chriſt, doth diſtinguiſh him not only from <hi>Joſhua</hi> Son o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Nun,</hi> but from every other Man in the World, (as being his proper Name) tho' never ſo good or great in God's Favour. We muſt know that <hi>Joſhua</hi> in bringing into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was the Type of Chriſt's bringing God's People into the Heavenly Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; therefore in relation to that Office, his Name was changed by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 13.16.</note> for his Name before was <hi>Oſhea:</hi> We muſt alſo take notice how thoſe two great Servants of <hi>God</hi> had two ſeveral ſhares, and acted two different parts, which both parts thereby Typified, were perform'd by the Lord Jeſus their Antitype; for <hi>Moſes</hi> brought the People out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but introduced them not into the Land of Promiſe, which <hi>Joſhua</hi> did, yet brought them not out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> but our Bleſſed Saviour is the Author, and will be the finiſher of both our Deliverances from the bondage of Sin, the Curſe of the Law, and from the power of Hell; and alſo he will lead us into Heaven and Glory, for he who hath began in and for us that good Work, will perfect it; to him, upon a ſurer ground, we may apply what <hi>Naomi</hi> ſaid of <hi>Boaz,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ruth 3.18</note> 
               <hi>He will not be in rest until he have finiſh'd the thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when we are upon the Name <hi>Joſhua, Jeſus,</hi> or Saviour, I am put in mind of that excellent place gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally granted to be ſpoken of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whom none but Jews will deny to be Jeſus Chriſt;<note place="margin">Iſa. 63.1.</note> 
               <hi>I am mighty to ſave;</hi> 'tis abſolutely ſaid <hi>mighty,</hi> of himſelf, not through the help of any one elſe:<note place="margin">v. 3.</note> For in the place he ſaith, <hi>I alone have trodden the Wine-preſs, and of the people there was none with me.</hi> No meer Man ever ſpoke after this rate, for there as God, he by the Mouth of the Prophet ſpeaks of himſelf; with this compare <hi>Zephaniah</hi> 3.7. <hi>The Lord thy God in the midſt of thee is mighty, he will ſave:</hi> One Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and that in both, a mighty one. Now mark how in a very different ſtile, the great Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt, which ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth me;</hi> ſuch a manner of ſpeaking, the Lord Jeſus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed; but it ſeems <hi>Paul</hi> doth point at the quoted place of the Prophet, when he ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt is able to ſave
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:30142:77"/>to the uttermoſt them who come unto God by him:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 7.25.</note> Here is a might to ſave not only in part, or only ſome, but fully, and to the uttermoſt, therefore the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by the Angel; <hi>Thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 1.21.</note> 
               <hi>for he ſhall ſave his people from their Sins:</hi> His People, that is, <hi>the Iſrael of God;</hi> for <hi>they are not all Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6.16. Rom. 9.6.</note> 
               <hi>which are of Iſrael.</hi> Now the Lord Jeſus is not only ſaid to be a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, which in his capacity of Mediator, may be called his proper Name, ſo that every one may know whom we mean thereby: This is the Character of God,<note place="margin">Iſa. 43.11.</note> 
               <hi>I even I am the Lord, and beſides me there is no Saviour:</hi> For in that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute way, in Scripture, none but God is ſo call'd; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the Abſtract Chriſt is ſaid to be Salvation, for he is the ſpring of it; <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 4.12.</note> which yet <hi>Socinians</hi> would lodge in every Man who can be ſaved if he will, but in the Word, God and Saviour go often together, and as to the thing are never aſunder, and as Chriſt is Saviour, ſo he is God. St. <hi>John,</hi> who better than all <hi>Socinians,</hi> knew who God is, and who Chriſt is, in his Writings doth often joyn God and Chriſt, when he commended God's Love to us, he meaned cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the true God by Nature; of him he ſaith,<note place="margin">1 John 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>Thereby we perceive the Love of God, becauſe he laid down his Life for us:</hi> None but the <hi>Patripaſſian</hi> Hereticks will ſay, That God the Father laid down his Life for us, but God the Son hath, as in the next Chapter he thus explains it; <hi>In this was manifeſted the Love of God towards us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">chap. 4.9.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe God ſent his only begotten Son into the World that we might live through him;</hi> ſo the God who laid down his Life for us, is the only begotten Son of God; <hi>Who,</hi> as is ſaid in the next Verſe, <hi>Was ſent to be the propitiation for our ſins;</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 10.</note> this was the end of his coming, and thus the laying down of his Life was a propitiatory Sacrifice of himſelf for our ſins.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Now God himſelf, and our Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 3.11.</note> 
               <hi>and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt direct our way unto you;</hi> here is a Prayer which is a Religious Worſhip directed to God himſelf: Who this God is, 'tis equally ſaid, our Father and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, equally prayed to, becauſe both equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able to perform and anſwer the Prayer's end, ſo that whether the Name God himſelf be taken eſſentially, then our Lord Chriſt is as well as the Father comprehended under it, or if perſonally, then to leave no doubt of it, by
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:30142:78"/>way of explanation, his Name is expreſs'd as well as that of the Father, and may no more than the Father be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from being God himſelf; but it would be almoſt an endleſs Work, if one would make uſe of all Texts in Scripture, which either directly or indirectly, by plain Aſſertions or good Conſequences prove Chriſt's Divinity, for one of the ends of the Goſpel is to declare Chriſt to be properly God,<note place="margin">Joh. 20.31.</note> Son of God: <hi>Theſe things are written that ye may believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God;</hi> yet <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> would make him to be like thoſe falſe Gods whom <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of in oppoſition to the true God, of them he gives this deſcription,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.17.</note> 
               <hi>They ſacrificed unto Devils, not to God, to Gods whom they knew not, to new Gods that came newly up.</hi> Theſe upſtart Gods were Devils which they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, no true God but what from all eternity is ſuch by Nature; now if the Lord Jeſus be, as they would have him, a God come up within theſe 1700 Years, whom they worſhip, I leave them to waſh off the obvious blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſequence. As to what they ſay, that he is God only by Office, and by vertue of his being anointed: I anſwer, Anointing was a Ceremony to make and declare a King, but the Anointing made him not a Man, for that he was before: Thus the Lord Jeſus the Son of God being Anointed, and made Chriſt, that Anointing indeed made and declared him a King, a Prophet and a Prieſt, and thereby thoſe Offices were conferred on him, but that could not make him God, for he was ſuch before; Chriſt is a Name of Office, as God is of Nature.</p>
            <p>Upon every other account they are full of their Cavils, thus they would have the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> not to be an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential incommunicable Name,<note place="margin">Pſal. 68.4.</note> which with that of <hi>Jah</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies his Nature and incomprehenſible Majeſty, whereby he is declared to be the only true God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to all falſe Gods, and they would have their falſe Notion to ſtand, becauſe they pretend that moſt Holy Name to be attributed to Creatures, as to the <hi>Ark, Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> &amp;c. which ſufficiently<note n="*" place="margin">

Zec. 14.20</note> I refuted elſewhere: This only I now ſhall add, that the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is no more attributed to the Ark, or any Creature, than that moſt holy Name, and Holineſs it ſelf is to the Bells of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; when 'tis ſaid, <hi>In that Day ſhall there be upon the Bells of the Horſes, Holineſs unto the Lord:</hi> But as they ſtrike at his Divine Nature, ſo they do againſt its eſſential At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:30142:78"/>as Omniſcience, which I alſo have ſpoken of: This I ſhall add, That when the Prophets knew of things to come, 'twas by vertue of Revelation; for 'tis often ſaid, <hi>The Word of the Lord came to me;</hi> thus things they knew from God, but the Lord Jeſus knew things from himſelf, whether paſt, or to come; as among other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman can ſhew about her five Husbands,<note place="margin">John 4. chap. 5, 6. Matt. 25. ch. 17.27. ch. 16.21. ch. 21.38. ch. 26.23. v. 34.</note> and that of the Man who had long been ſick: He alſo knew future things, thus he foretold the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> about forty Years before it happened; thus of the Fiſh which <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould catch, and of the piece of Money in his Mouth; ſo he foretold his Death, and the manner of that of <hi>Peter</hi>'s, that <hi>Judas</hi> ſhould betray, and <hi>Peter</hi> deny him, and ſeveral other things. Now this, in God's Language, proves Chriſt's Divinity, becauſe foretelling of things to come, is given as a Character of the true God, as we have it,<note place="margin">Iſa. 41.22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are Gods,</hi> after he in the foregoing Verſe had ſaid, <hi>Let them ſhew us what ſhall happen, or declare things for to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a conſiderable place to prove our Lord's Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which muſt be to the purpoſe, ſeeing <hi>Paul</hi> as good an Interpreter of Scripture as any of them all, makes uſe of it in the ſame ſenſe as we do: The words of the Pſalm are theſe, <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 45.6. Heb. 8.</note> which the Apoſtle apply'd to the Son Jeſus Chriſt; but as they are apt to take unjuſt Exceptions at any thing that hits them; ſo they do at this, and would give the words only a literal ſenſe relating to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Marriage with <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter: We may own ſomething therein to relate to <hi>Solomon,</hi> but withal 'tis chiefly in a ſpiritual way intended to repreſent Chriſt's Union with his Church, and that 'tis not <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Epithalamy, or a Pſalm upon his Marriage, it appears from the very firſt Verſe; <hi>My heart is inditing a good matter,</hi> for certainly Marrying <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter, was no good matter, for abſolutely God had forbidden his People <hi>to make any Marriage with other Nations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 7.3. 1 Kings 11.3, 4.</note> and that Wife of his was one of thoſe who <hi>turn'd his Heart af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other Gods</hi> to ſerve them: Beſides what is ſaid therein, <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever,</hi> doth not belong to <hi>Solomon;</hi> nor what is ſaid, <hi>The King's Daughter is all glorious within,</hi> to his Wife.</p>
            <pb n="148" facs="tcp:30142:79"/>
            <p>Their diſtinction of moſt high, which they would attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute only to the Father, and of high God, to the Son, to make him a ſubordinate God, is frivolous, for in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity that makes no difference: The true God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is ſometimes call'd ſo in the ſuperlative degree, and at other times in the poſitive, yet that diſtinction doth not make two Gods of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> in one and the ſame Pſalm he is called by both Titles in one Verſe the moſt High,<note place="margin">Pſal. 78.56.35.</note> 
               <hi>And they tempted and provoked the most high God;</hi> and in another before 'tis ſaid, <hi>They remembered that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer;</hi> ſo that God, the high God, and the moſt high God, is but one and the ſame God.</p>
            <p>The Record which <hi>John Baptist</hi> bare of our Saviour ought to be weighty, (for God ſent him to the end he ſhould bear it,) and alſo unqueſtionable, for then he ſpake againſt himſelf, when he gave Chriſt the whole preference, which muſt be attributed only to his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth:<note place="margin">John 1.15.27, 30.</note> The record is this, <hi>He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me:</hi> Which Truth is of ſo high a concernment to be known, that in one and the ſame chapter 'tis thrice mentioned, and in every one of thoſe Verſes 'tis applied to Chriſt, who is directly pointed at, in theſe words, <hi>This was he of whom I ſpake,</hi> and <hi>he it is who coming after me,</hi> and <hi>this is he of whom I ſaid.</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">

For here the words relate to their Birth; now, we muſt believe, that in theſe two Phraſes, he comes after me, and he was before me, there is Truth, Reaſon, good Senſe, and no Contradiction; in the ſame reſpect he cannot be ſaid
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:30142:79"/>to come after and be before, but it muſt be in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent one, which is this, (and if they can, let them aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign another,) he comes after me into the World, as <hi>ver.</hi> 10. that is, he was born after me, which is the plain Truth, for the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 1.36.</note> ſix Months after <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had Conceived, foretold the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> our Saviour's Birth; ſo that according to the uſual Courſe of Nature, the Lord Jeſus was born ſix Months after <hi>John,</hi> and in that ſenſe, he came after him. But how was he Born before him, ſeeing in relation to his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Generation he was after? It muſt be in regard of a Generation of another kind, for no Man hath, or can have but one Natural Generation, and can be born but once; what elſe then may it be, but an Eternal one, by vertue of which, Chriſt in his time, was before <hi>John?</hi> For ſaith <hi>John,</hi> he <hi>was,</hi> not <hi>is</hi> before me, to ſhew how the queſtion is about time: And if in one ſenſe, Chriſt had been but ſix Months before <hi>John,</hi> as he was born ſix Months after, then in that ſenſe, we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude for hundreds and thouſands of Years, and ſo to Eternity.</p>
            <p>Our bleſſed Lord and Saviour to give an Example, and to condeſcend to the frailty of our Nature, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to draw Men to himſelf by degrees, was lowly and humble, yet without any prejudice to his Right, which, when queſtioned, he maintained, and upon ſeveral occaſions aſſerted, though ſometimes to the danger of his Life. He could tell the Jews,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.38. ch. 8.14.23.</note> 
               <hi>I came down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and though I bear record of my ſelf, yet my record is true, for I know whence I came and whither I go.</hi> 'Tis a ſpecial Prerogative of God to bear Record of himſelf, again, <hi>Ye are from beneath, I am from above, ye are of this world, I am not of this world.</hi> And as he told them,<note place="margin">ch. 10.38.</note> that if they believed not his word, yet <hi>they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his works,</hi> which were ſo Glorious and Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and clear Demonſtrations of his Divine Nature and Power; he ſaid that <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Sickneſs was <hi>for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by:</hi> Son of God ſimply and abſolutely is God; in that caſe he ſpake of himſelf, for by raiſing <hi>Lazarus,</hi> as he did, from the Dead, he thereby was Glorified, and he that was Glorified was God, Son of God; for as there was but one Glory, ſo there was but one God Glorified
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:30142:80"/>This verſe ought to be compared with the 40. where Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Martha, Said I not unto thee, that if thou wouldeſt believe thou ſhouldſt ſee the glory of God:</hi> That is his own Glory, by her Brother's Reſurrection, which he was juſt upon going to eſſect; ſo in the other caſe of the Man that was Blind from his Birth, he ſaid to his Diſciples that <hi>He was born blind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">chap. 9.3.</note> 
               <hi>that the work of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him.</hi> Which happened, when he by his own Divine Power gave him his Sight, and was thereby Glorified as God. We muſt obſerve how the Son of God abſolutely taken as 'tis here, is God, as well as the Son of Man is Man: And the Lord Jeſus doth explain the firſt part, <hi>for the glory of God,</hi> by the laſt, <hi>that the Son of God be glorified,</hi> which ſhews it to be the ſame, or equivalent: Thus in another place, our Saviour interprets the Phraſe, <hi>making himſelf God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">chap. 10.33.36.</note> by ſaying, <hi>I am the Son of God,</hi> with calling himſelf Son of God, in his and their Senſe, he certainly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made himſelf God, which they called Blaſphemy, but he deny'd it to be ſo, though he owned, he had call'd himſelf God, and in the very ſenſe that they had taken it.</p>
            <p>Becauſe our Lord ſometimes call'd himſelf Son of Man, they would take advantage of it, but when he did, it was to point at the Promiſe made to our firſt Parents, that the Woman's Seed ſhould bruiſe the Serpent's Head, and to teach Men how they ought to look upon him as being that ſame Seed, who was come not to conquer Kingdoms, as at that time the Jews fancied, but to execute the Promiſe of bruiſing the Serpent's Head;<note place="margin">Joh. 10.36.</note> when he called himſelf Son of Man, he ſpoke the truth, but he thereby denied not that he was the Son of God; for ſometimes he call'd himſelf by that Name, and to confirm this great and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truth, there ſtands upon record, and ſhall to the Worlds end, the famous Confeſſion of <hi>Peter</hi> in his and of all the Apoſtles Name upon a ſolemn occaſion, <hi>Thou art the Son of the Living God;</hi> a truth which came not out of his own Head, or out of any humane Principle, but was from Heaven immediately revealed unto him; namely, that Jeſus Chriſt was by Office the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and by Nature the true Son of the living God: Now if he had been Son of God only by deputation, there had been no need of Revelation, but at that time 'twas neceſſary to let Men
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:30142:80"/>know how he is ſuch by Nature, and to refute the wrong Notions which the Jews had of our Saviour, God thought fit to inform them better with declaring his Divinity, and this is one of thoſe <hi>Myſteries of the Kingdom of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 8.10.</note> which the Lord Jeſus ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>It was given unto them to know;</hi> wherein he plainly declared how in and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his teaching, in Religion were Myſteries not to be known but by the Gift of God and Revelation: And I think he was a competent Judge of ſuch things; and when he call'd himſelf Son of God, he could alſo tell whether or not he was ſo, which to prove further, I ſhall go on.</p>
            <p>And with the Apoſtle ſay,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.4.</note> 
               <hi>He that made all things is God;</hi> that is truly and properly God of himſelf, now in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places Scripture ſaith, <hi>All things were made by the Word,</hi> which Name <hi>John</hi> uſually calls Chriſt by,<note place="margin">John 1.3.10.

               <hi>The World was made by him,</hi> which him or that Perſon, <hi>Paul</hi> in two places ſpeaking of this ſame point of Creation, calls the Son of God, <hi>by whom all things were made,</hi> and <hi>by whom he made the Worlds,</hi> and ſo all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for by the Expreſſion, <hi>All things in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. are underſtood all the Works of Nature, the whole Work of the Creation: But to elude the weight of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which lies heavy upon them, ſometimes (for they are apt to change and diverſifie their Notions, and are conſtant only in unhappy Contrivances how to wreſt Scripture) they ſay that the name <hi>Word,</hi> ſignifies Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and not the Perſon of Chriſt, which Notion I<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſwer to Lett.</hi> I. p. 29, 30.</note> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where have ſpoken againſt; but at other times, when they are preſs'd, and cannot deny it to belong to Chriſt, then to ſhift it off, they ſay the name <hi>Word</hi> is taken for his Prophetical Office; but the Evangeliſt gives it for Chriſt's proper and perſonal Name, for that very name is given him upon another account, and in a different oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, when he was ſeen in his Glory and Majeſty, as a King at the Head of Heavenly Armies, going to fight; there 'tis ſaid, <hi>his name is called the Word of God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 19.13. <hi>ver.</hi> 16.</note> and in that place he is ſtyled, <hi>King of kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> So 'tis not in relation to his Prophetical Office, for the ſtate wherein he then appeared, had been very improper; he was a horſe-back, not to ſpeak and teach, but to fight; ſo then the name is not given him upon the account of his Prophetical Office: If this be a name of Office, what's the reaſon why none of the Prophets or
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:30142:81"/>Apoſtles, who taught and preach'd God's Word, were never call'd by the name, <hi>the Word;</hi> 'tis often ſaid, that the Word of the Lord came to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but never that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> or any of them, was the Word of the Lord; and this <hi>Word</hi> now in queſtion was the Son of God,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.21. 1 Pet. 1.11.

               <hi>The power of all the kingdoms of the World is delivered unto me, and to whomſoever I will I give it.</hi> So we may ſay of his Children, <hi>They bend their tongues like their bow for lies:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 9.3.</note> 
               <hi>but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to go on, I muſt obſerve how the Lord abſolutely and ſubjectively taken, doth in <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſtile ever imply the Perſon of the Lord Jeſus: So in <hi>John</hi>'s ſtile, the Name <hi>Word</hi> uſed in the ſame manner doth always ſignifie the ſame Perſon: And our Saviour, the Eternal Son of God, call'd by the Names of <hi>Jehovah, Lord, God, Son of God,</hi> who at ſeveral times was in Human Shape ſeen by the Patriarchs, and ſpoken of by the Prophets, is the ſame who in the fulneſs of the Times was made Man in the Virgins Womb, his Body by the Operation of the Holy Ghoſt having out of her Subſtance been therein form'd and preſerved from natural human Corruption, not that he was tranſubſtantiated into Fleſh, for what is changed into another, ceaſes to be what he was, and begins to be what he was not, but God can never ceaſe to be what he is, nor become what he was not: But to return to the Name <hi>the Word,</hi> when the words are the ſame, and about the ſame Subject, we may believe the Thoughts and the ſenſe to be the ſame, for the meaning is expreſs'd by words. In the firſt Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> the Name God is eleven times in a true and proper ſenſe made uſe of, and in that whole Goſpel, nor in the whole New Teſtament,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:30142:81"/>can any inſtance be given that the abſolute word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, God, in the Singular, be improperly taken, but always properly, ſo we muſt take the word in the uſual and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe of the Scripture, rather than in the improper and metaphorical of <hi>Socinians:</hi> So when <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Word was God, we muſt properly underſtand the Names <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> the firſt of the Perſon, the ſecond of the Nature: Here they would ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil with ſaying, God is the Subject, the Word the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, but certainly there being the Article <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, ſheweth the contrary; but indeed the Exception is frivolous, becauſe <hi>eſſentialia praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata ſunt reciproca,</hi> the eſſential Predicates are converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; if God be the Word, the Word muſt be God: Take notice how as by the Word God the true God is to be underſtood, ſo when 'tis ſaid the Word was God, 'tis meant the Word was the true God. They object, he that is with one, is not the ſame whom he is with, ſo the Word muſt needs be one, and God another; but they will not take notice how the Evangeliſt ſaith not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Word was with God, but alſo in the ſame Verſe, that <hi>the Word was God,</hi> which is ſo plain as to need no Interpretation: But to anſwer in the School way, I ſay, he is not the ſame <hi>formalitèr &amp; ſub eodem conceptu,</hi> formally and under the ſame Notion, but in a different; here are two Perſons, he who is, and he whom he is with, we confound not but diſtinguiſh the Perſons, the <hi>Word</hi> is eſſentially God, tho' not relatively the Perſon of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>They move every Stone, if poſſible, to ſerve their turn, therefore as they would rob the Lord Jeſus of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving created the World, ſo they go about to deprive him of preſerving and upholding it; for what is ſaid of <hi>God's upholding all things by the Word of his Power,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1.3. Coloſ. 1.17</note> which in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place is thus, <hi>By him all things conſiſt,</hi> which means thè ſame as the other; yet the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, rendered by to <hi>uphold,</hi> they would Tranſlate to <hi>govern,</hi> which is an idle nicety, he that governs well doth uphold what he governs, ſo that provided the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, we will not ſtand upon the word; only they ought to take notice of a thing material to our purpoſe, how their Notion doth not conſiſt with the ſcope of the place, for there the Apoſtle ſpeaks not of Chriſt's Kingdom, but of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:30142:82"/>his Perſon, call'd the brightneſs of the Glory, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Image of the Father's Perſon;<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1.19.</note> ſo in that other, <hi>A pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell;</hi> 'tis not ſpoken of the Doctrine, but of the Perſon of Chriſt: That ſort of Men firſt do what they can to wreſt God's Word, which abominably they generally do in the Texts about Chriſt's Satisfaction, and almoſt in every other Point, but when they ſee that cannot do, they fly in the Face of Holy Writers: Thus<note n="*" place="margin">Schlich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingius.</note> one of them upon the words, <hi>But a Body haſt thou prepared me,</hi> ſaith how theſe words the Apoſtle quoted not to his purpoſe, <hi>Non neceſſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>'Tis not neceſſary to believe that the Author in his quotation of the words, had any regard unto their proper ſenſe, but had quoted them only becauſe they were joined with others that were to his purpoſe:</hi> Which in him is not only an ignorance of the Scope of the place, but alſo a Reflection upon the Apoſtle, as if he had not well known what he ſaid, and wherefore, as if he at that time had not been Inſpired of God, which is both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs and Impiety: However, they cannot deny him to have been a very Rational Man, but they will be for <hi>Deiſm,</hi> or Natural Religion in oppoſition to Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If ſeriouſly and impartially we look upon <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> we may about the things in queſtion, well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with the Scribes, Phariſees, and Sadducees, that were in our Saviour's and his Apoſtles days, as being acted by the ſame Evil Spirit as they were, and equally full of Gall and Bitterneſs againſt the Perſon, Honour, and Doctrine of our Lord, whom upon all occaſions theſe do, as the others did undervalue, taking him for a meer Man, and conſequently, for a Lyar and Impoſtour, when he called himſelf true God, Son of God, in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer equal with the Father, and one with him: Thus Impiouſly the Jews call'd him a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> who had a Devil, a Seducer, a Deceiver, a Malefactor, and a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer. The Phariſees were full of Pride and Self-Conceit, would paſs for the only Good, Knowing, Wiſe Men in the World, ſat in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Chair, nam'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves his Diſciples, ſaid of thoſe who were not of their Opinion about Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>This People who knows not the law are curſed.</hi> How did they uſe the blind-born Man, when to them he ſpoke good Senſe and Reaſon, <hi>Thou waſt altogether born in ſin,</hi>

               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:30142:82"/>Implying, as if they were not born in ſin, but were Pure and Holy. Likewiſe, <hi>Socinians</hi> pretend to a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical Righteouſneſs, they were not born in ſin, for they ſay, there is in them no Original Sin, and they pretend they can in this World attain to ſuch a Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as not to Sin; alſo with the <hi>Sadducees</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Reſurrection of the Dead, at leaſt of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo of the Good too as to the Body. The Scribes and Phariſees could not deny the mighty and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Works of our bleſſed Lord, for they were Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, done not in a Corner, but in many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places, and in the preſence of Thouſands of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nay, in their Council they confeſs'd it, and ſaid, <hi>What do we?

This is the very Caſe of <hi>Socinians,</hi> they cannot deny the Supreme Divine Power which the Lord Jeſus exerted in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Actions, nor abſolutely deny him to be God, they cannot convince him of Lye, nor of any Sin: They cannot be ignorant of the Teſtimony which more than once from Heaven, the Father gave of him, neither the Record which <hi>John</hi> bare of him, nor that, which upon ſeveral occaſions he gave of himſelf; as to his Divine Nature and Power, this they cannot deny, but will not confeſs it, and hold the Truth of God in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs: whereupon, we muſt ſay they are worſe than the Rulers, Elders, Scribes, Phariſees, and Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cees, who upon the account of a Miracle done by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> by the Power of our Saviour, and in his Name, ſaid, <hi>we cannot deny it,</hi>

            <p>When he ſpeaks as God the Maker of the World, he uſeth one kind of Stile, and when as Man, who had in our ſtead ſubjected himſelf to the Curſe and Penalty of the Law, another. Yet tho' he ſuffered not as God, he ceaſed not to be God; as the Sun behind a Cloud ceaſeth not in it ſelf to be bright and glorious, ſo the Lord Jeſus's Divine Nature under the Vail of the Fleſh, had not loſt her Divine Glory, which during the time of his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was hidden from Man's Eyes; yet ſtill ſome Beams thereof appeared in his Baptiſm, in his Transfiguration and Miracles, but after his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion was manifeſted, as is the brightneſs of the Sun when the Cloud is diſperſed; then indeed he was again glorified with the Father, with the Glory which he had with him
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:30142:84"/>before the World was. This leads me to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſideration, which if well minded, can by God's Bleſſing contribute to the better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this whole matter: After the manner of Man, that is, weakly and imperfectly, we may conceive God infinitely, Glorious in himſelf, yet as his great and ultimate end, is and ever was to promote that Glory of his, he from all Eternity decreed to glorifie himſelf for ever and ever, by the Manifeſtation of his Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Juſtice, and every other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute; and as the firſt in Intention is the laſt in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, ſo in order thereunto, to communicate himſelf he reſolved to create the World, and in the viſible part of it to lodge Man as the Chief of his Creatures, and to permit him to ſin, and thereby become guilty of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Damnation: And as God is glorified in the ways of Mercy and of Juſtice, ſo he alſo reſolved, of whole Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to make Objects of theſe two Attributes, to ſave ſome through free Grace, and to leave others in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural State of ſin: And as in the Work of Creation, ſo in that of Redemption, the Three Perſons of the moſt Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, agreed about the Means conducing to that End: The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was to ſend his Son Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Epeſ. 3.4.</note> 
               <hi>in whom he hath choſen us before the foundation of the World.</hi> The Son to come, purchaſe and work Salvation for us, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt to apply that Purchaſe, and make it effectual: In order to this, the whole Adminiſtration of this great and Glorious Work was committed to the Son,<note place="margin">Acts 10.36.

In <hi>John</hi>'s time, the Hereſiark <hi>Cerinthus</hi> denyed our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Divinity, which that Goſpel proves as often, fully and plainly, as any Book whatſoever in the the New Teſtament, as indeed that Apoſtle did write it a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to prove it, and thereby to confute the Impious Hereſie of that Inſtrument of Satan, as he declares it, when he ſaith, <hi>Theſe things are written that ye might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the ſon of God,</hi>

               <hi>and that ye might have life through his name:</hi> To ſay a proof is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a thing when 'tis viſibly for it, gives a juſt cauſe to put the queſtion, whether he or they who ſaid ſo, knew what they ſaid. But Drowning Men will lay hold on any thing that comes into their Hand.

            <p>This Holy Goſpel doth confound the Enemies of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour's Divinity, therefore, they ſo often would have been nibbling at it; not one chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but affords ſtrong proofs of it: For not to mention here thoſe ſeveral places out of which we have drawn ſtrong Arguments for it; How many things to confirm it, did the Lord Jeſus ſpeak therein from the time of his eating the Paſſover till he was taken, that was but ſhort, which he took to prepare his Diſciples, for that ſeparation which by his Death was to follow, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with telling what he would, and could do for them: I ſhall take notice of that only where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

            <p>I heretofore, as I hope, have ſufficiently beaten down the vain Idol of their own Reaſon, and demonſtrated how idle and frivolous a thing it is in Religious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, except it be enlightned and ſanctified by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: All the Skill and Learning of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> which in the ſight of Men was very conſiderable, would have done <hi>Abraham</hi> no good towards the true Knowledge of God, without Revelation, but God appearing and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, made him know him well and in the true manner, which his own Reaſon could never have led him into, as Revelation did: His Faith was grounded upon the Declaration and the Promiſe, ſo, as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.8.</note> 
               <hi>He went out not knowing whither he went,</hi> guided not by his Reaſon but by Faith, as indeed Matters of Religion do far exceed the Eye of human Reaſon; this makes the great Apoſtle, who had ſo many Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to call the Goſpel not Myſtery but Myſteries in

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> are excluded from the benefit of it; the words are plain, <hi>Provided always, and be it farther Enacted by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity aforeſaid, that neither this Act, nor any Clauſe, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, or any thing herein contained, ſhall extend, or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to extend to give any eaſe, benefit, or advantage to any Papiſt or Popiſh Recuſant whatſoever, or any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſhall deny in his Preaching or Writing, the Doctrine of the Bleſſed Trinity, as are declared in the aforeſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion.</hi> After this, we may well wonder at any one, who will ſay there is any benefit by this Act intended for <hi>Socinians,</hi> it appearing ſo much to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that there is no Toleration allowed them.</p>
            <p>By what I ſaid out of the Act, it ſufficiently appears how binding it is againſt thoſe who deny the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as <hi>Socinians:</hi> For they who pretend to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it, to qualifie themſelves, muſt not only take the Oath to the Government, but alſo ſubſcribe to every Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal Article of the 39, in the firſt and ſecond where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of chiefly, the Anti-Trinitarian deteſtable Hereſie is fully Condemned: This as to the Letter of the Law, but herein, according to the Goſpel, there is a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Prudence to be uſed, <hi>Socinians,</hi> as well as <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> have Equivocations, and mental Reſervations: They ſometimes to ſerve their turn, ſubſcribe things, which, as ſome of them have been heard to ſay, either they do not underſtand, or elſe have within themſelves a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular meaning thereof. Now upon ſuch occaſions, the Officers concerned to tender the Oaths and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Subſcriptions, ought to be Cautious how they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſome Men to't. In a Tract I have written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Oaths, I mentioned ſeveral neceſſary things
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:30142:90"/>upon this matter, only this I ſhall ſay for the preſent, that when there is no ground of Suſpicion, nor any thing to create doubts of the Sincerity of him or them that are to Swear and Subſcribe, then the Oath and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to end the buſineſs, may be admitted, leaving it for God to judge of the Truth and Reality of the Party concerned: But it ſhould be otherwiſe, when there is cauſe to doubt of a Man's ſincerity, for fear of being Inſtrumental in his Ruin and Damnation; I would not eaſily believe a Man whom I have ground to ſuſpect he is a Lyar, nor tender an Oath to one whom I hear to be apt to forſwear; I do not ſay, a Man may abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſe to put him to his Oath, but not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to his Perjury, I would be very wary and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and endeavour to find out whether he be real; or comes with an ill deſign: Why ſhould I put a Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or a Cup of Poiſon into the hand of one who may happen not to be ſound in his Mind, and not <hi>Compos Mentis,</hi> therewith to Stab and Poiſon himſelf or others; in this caſe of Hereſie, we have a conſiderable inſtance in the Perſon of <hi>Arrius,</hi> whom we heard of, when I ſpake of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> 'tis thus, The Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> upon the ſuggeſtions of an <hi>Arrian</hi> Prieſt, (whom his Siſter <hi>Conſtantia</hi> upon her Death-bed had commended to his favour,) how <hi>Arrius</hi> had to his <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty,</hi> been miſ-repreſented, for his Opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe Matters, was the ſame with the Judgment of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and that if he were pleaſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him into his preſence, he with his own Mouth would aſſure him of it, the Emperour, who would not in the leaſt recede from the Reſolutions of the Council, was upon thoſe terms content to ſee him, ſo he comes, and in ſound words, gave him a ſhort Confeſſion of what he ſaid he believed concerning thoſe Matters, afterwards <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ask'd him, whether he would ſubſcribe to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil's Determinations, which he readily did, yet the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to make ſure of him, required him to ſwear to the truth of what he had ſubſcribed, which he alſo did; thus he impoſed upon the Emperour, but could not upon God who, as I ſaid before, found out, and Puniſhed him. I am perſwaded that many <hi>Socinians</hi> after the Example of this their great Ring-leader, to get leave to ſet up Anti-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Conventicles, will, if they can, impoſe upon the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:30142:90"/>Law, ſubſcribe and ſwear unto any thing, for they have the face to declare, if we will believe them, that <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians, the Catholick Church, the Tranſlatour,</hi> as they call one, <hi>and I, are at perfect Agreement?</hi> but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I ſufficiently ſhewed in my Anſwer to their two Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Still I am of Opinion, that for their ends, they will do, ſay, ſign, and transform themſelves into any thing; therefore let thoſe who are concerned, look to them when they offer to ſwear and ſubſcribe.</p>
            <p>Thus having taken notice of the Law, I muſt not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to do ſo of the Goſpel, and Addreſs my ſelf to the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Shepherds of his Flock, whoſe Duty it is not only to feed, but alſo defend it from the Wolves; elſe in Scripture Phraſe they are <hi>Idol Shepherds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zec. 11.17</note> and <hi>dumb Dogs.</hi> Not Shepherds, but Hirelings, for ſaith the great Shepherd of all, <hi>He that is an hireling,</hi>

In ſuch things we muſt not mind ſo much what Men will ſay as what God will? To loyal Subjects their Princes Enemies are theirs, ſo true Chriſtians ought to account Chriſt's Enemies to be theirs; God forbid, we ſhould under the wrong Notion of Charity, betray our Allegiance to him, our Conſcience, or the Truth. As to <hi>Socinians,</hi> I wiſh the gentleneſs of the Parliament towards them, may lead them to the knowledge of their deteſtable Errors, and prove an Inducement to repent and leave them off, leſt their Charity being exhauſted, and Patience tired out, in their Chriſtian Prudence and Zeal for God, ſeeing mild Courſes cannot prevail, they make uſe of harder ones.

               <hi>and he that condemneth the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, are abomination to the Lord:</hi> I cannot blame Men for being cautious how to prevent Inconveniencies, as much as 'tis poſſible, leſt the harmleſs ſhould be involved in the ſame Condemnation with the miſchievous Man, which hath ſometimes happened, and ſo may again, but for Men without a juſt and viſible cauſe to be over fearful, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues either a faintedneſs in the Heart, or a guilt in the Conſcience; however let a due Prudence be made uſe of, both in fixing the Guilt, and inflicting the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Guilty: As 'tis neceſſary and juſt that Men ſhould plainly know what they are forbidden, and muſt avoid; ſo out of Chriſtian Prudence there ought a difference to be made between the ſeducer and ſeduced, the obſtinate and ignorant, the leader and the miſ-led.<note place="margin">Deut. 22.19, 29.</note> 'Tis to be taken notice of, how under the Law there were Fines and Money-penalties laid upon Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which may be a warning for theſe times.

               <hi>thorough the unſearchable judgments of God,</hi> which is a continuation of that which their Fore-fathers had from the beginning. But <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> we may look upon with a different eye, for they are Apoſtatized from the Truth, which the <hi>Jews</hi> never profeſſed: and continuing obſtinate in their Blaſphemies, they deſerve <hi>to be delivered unto Satan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.20.</note> 
               <hi>that they may learn not to blaſpheme.</hi> This is <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s Direction and Practice.</p>
            <p>VVhen a Law is to be made, to prevent its becoming a ſnare, it ought to be worded in as plain, full, and clear Terms as poſſibly may be; though for all that, at one time or other, ſome, out of perverſeneſs of Nature, will ſtudy how to wreſt it: And no wonder ſeeing they attempt to put falſe Gloſſes upon God's Word, even in thoſe places which are as plain as can be. But from a general Rule to come to a particular one, which is what I now purpoſe, I ſhall now reduce it to the caſe of Blaſphemy, about which the Controverſie is between the <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Socinians:</hi> The occaſion of my coming to this, when I was juſt upon concluding this Diſcourſe, is given me a ſheet of Paper, under the Name of a <hi>Caution about paſſing the Bill againſt Blaſphemy,</hi> whereof the Author goes upon two Heads, the <hi>firſt,</hi> VVhat Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy is in it ſelf? the <hi>ſecond,</hi> How far the Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority may go to ſuppreſs it? This Paper tends to what moſt of their others do, to make all Diſſenters, even the beſt ſort, to think that there is a deſign to diſquiet them; but the cloven Foot cannot be hidden, for all that own the Doctrinal part of the <hi>Thirty nine Articles,</hi> are not affected, only thoſe that be Blaſphemers, and prophane Men, and 'tis what they are afraid of: 'Tis very reaſonable and juſt to make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Ceremonial and Doctrinal, Circumſtantial and Eſſential; to cut a little Bough is one thing, but to lay the Axe at the Root of the Tree, is much ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The Definition or Deſcription therein given of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, namely, <hi>A ſpeaking evil of God,</hi> is not full and comprehenſive enough, but in the next Page he adds ſomething as <hi>an irreligious and ſcornful treating of the Divine Majeſty in his Nature and Attributes;</hi> but ſtill
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:30142:93"/>this is defective, for Blaſphemy is not only againſt the Nature and Attributes, but alſo againſt the Perſons of the Godhead, and againſt the Word and Works of God. For Scripture doth plainly ſpeak of Blaſphemy againſt the Son of God, Jeſus Chriſt, and againſt the Holy Ghoſt by Name, as elſewhere I gave ſome Inſtances of: ſo 'tis Blaſphemy to ſpeak againſt what is clearly ſaid in God's Word, for herein men give God the lye, and make a Lyar of the God of Truth: 'Tis alſo Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to ſay, that all that God made was not good, and that in all his VVorkings he is not juſt and wiſe: Again, we Chriſtians own the Knowledge and Belief of the Trinity to be as Eſſential in Religion, as that of the Deity, for not to know and believe the true God is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm, as well as not to know and believe a God. We own we may by Nature know there is a God, but to know who is that true God, we muſt depend upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, which nameth Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, whereunto our Faith muſt acquieſce: ſo 'tis not every Knowledge of God that can ſerve, only the true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him in Three Perſons, which to deny is Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phemy.</p>
            <p>By means of a diſtinction he makes of Blaſphemy, he would leſſen and ſo ſecure it from being puniſh'd by the Magiſtrate, which is the thing they chiefly aim at: we know in this as in every other Sin, by means of ſome Circumſtances there is a gradual difference, which makes it greater or leſſer, aggravates or extenuates it; thus one hath in his mind evil Thoughts, and blaſphemous Opinions; whence they paſs into the heart, thence come into the mouth, or drop from the Pen, and are ſet forth in Lives and Converſation; theſe from the very Spring deſerve God's Judgements, for though in relation to the other degrees, ſomething of Excuſe might be pleaded for, as ariſing out of Ignorance, or of a miſtaken Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and that in relation to men, there might be ſome charitable Allowance; yet in regard to God, they are a damnable Guilt which ſtands in need of Pardon, that makes <hi>Paul</hi> ſay,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.13.</note> 
               <hi>He obtained mercy becauſe he did it ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly:</hi> but as to ſome men, as long as they confine their blaſphemous Opinions in their mind, and within themſelves, no Law nor Magiſtrate doth or can take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it; but they do and ought, when contrary to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:30142:93"/>and Law, to the Diſturbance of Church or State, they promote and publiſh, and that preſumptuouſly too, thoſe blaſphemous Opinions of theirs: 'Tis true, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in out of miſtake or partiality, ſome things may be amiſs on the executive Part, however for all that, it doth not follow but that a due Care muſt be taken to puniſh and ſuppreſs the Evils of Blaſphemy or Hereſie; and they who ſee not a neceſſity of it, muſt needs through their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, have a thick miſt raiſed before their eyes, and if they be not under ſome ſuch Conviction, it ought to be attributed to the ſwimming Conceit of their own Head, and to a deluded or wounded Imagination, or to a high Ferment of Paſſions.</p>
            <p>But to ſecure themſelves from Puniſhment for Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they pitch upon <hi>three</hi> ways; the <hi>firſt,</hi> That in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Terms of Scripture the thing ought to be declared Blaſphemy, which is very unreaſonable, becauſe there are ſo many Caſes, that Scripture doth not expreſs every one; but 'tis enough to have them implyed, for Particulars are contained under Generals, as we eaſily ſee it in the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> of the Moral Law, in things therein commanded or forbidden; ſometime 'tis enough to have things deduced by good and natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences; this was our Saviour's way in his Diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Sadducees</hi> about the Reſurrection, they brought their Cavils wherewith they thought to have entangled him in difficulties with their Argument drawn from the Woman who had had ſeven Husbands, but he ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the Sophiſm, and then to prove the Point, brought in his Argument not out of expreſs words in Scripture,<note place="margin">Luke. 20.27, 28, 29, &amp;c.</note> but by a Deduction and good Conſequence, and to the Purpoſe, for, I hope, <hi>Socinians,</hi> who in their Diſputes do follow the Cavilling way of the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> though they will not own him to be true Eſſential God, yet they dare not deny him to have been a very Rational Man. If God be the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who then were dead, and God be the God not of the Dead but of the Living, it followeth, that at one time or other, namely, at the laſt Day, they ſhould be made alive, which can be no otherwiſe, than by a Reſurrection. Their <hi>ſecond</hi> way is, when we give them poſitive and expreſs Proofs out of Scriptures, then they go about to force improper
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:30142:94"/>and unuſual Significations upon the words. Their <hi>third</hi> way, is ſometimes to raiſe ſuch unneceſſary Difficulties, as are very hard, if not impoſſible to be reſolved by Men, thus they talk of a Self-condemned Heretick on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be puniſhed: Indeed a really Converted Heretick will declare his Sin, his Sorrow for, and Repentance of it; but in caſe there be no ſuch Self-condemning Blaſphemer, for it happens but very ſeldom, though he be known to be Guilty by many Overt Acts, as Diſcourſes, Pamphlets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt he be let alone: But I ſay that ſuch as are Self-condemners, and confeſs their Guilt, are Objects fitter for Mercy than for Judgment; on the contrary, thoſe who will not own their Fault, but continue in a denial of it, deſerve Puniſhment more than Favour, and except they confeſs, how can Men know they are Self-condemned? 'Tis by him added, <hi>I ſay again, to make a culpable and puniſhable Blaſphemer, there muſt be an Irreligious and Deſpiteful Intention in the words of the Perſon accuſed.</hi> When alas, the moſt wicked do often pretend moſt to Piety, and conceal their Evil Deſigns under Specious and Hypocritical Pretences, is it an eaſie thing to know Man's Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? How few Self-Accuſing, and Self-Condemning Men is there in the World.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould I any longer inſiſt upon what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in leſs than a Sheet of Paper, when at large, and more daringly we have theſe, and and many more things in a<note n="*" place="margin">An Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Power of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Matters of Religion.</note> late Book, which ſome of their own do ſet a high value upon, for the Author of one of the two Letters againſt my Epiſtle, doth highly commend it to be read, and though ſuch Commendations I do not much value; yet, juſt when I was upon concluding this, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence having brought it into my Hand, I read it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the Countrey; and not to be altogether ſilent upon't, and give every one his due, in few things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I ſhall agree with him, as in what he calls Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he makes his ſtrongeſt Argument of, againſt former Proceedings of Church and State; for certainly, there hath been a great ſeverity and bitterneſs uſed about indifferent Circumſtances and Ceremonies, againſt thoſe who refuſed to Conform thereunto, which of late ſome are become ſenſible of, and could wiſh ſuch things
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:30142:94"/>had never happened; and may be this Author having been Paſſively concern'd,<note place="margin">Judg. 16.28.</note> deſires <hi>to be avenged for his two Eyes;</hi> but this they ſay out of a deſign to diſunite thoſe, who ought all to Unite againſt them, who are become the common Enemy, about much higher things than thoſe in queſtion at that time; we ought to make a great difference between cutting a Button off my Cloaths, and tearing them all in pieces; certainly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution is an odious thing, but ſometimes the name is miſapply'd. We own, that in the way of Penalties to puniſh thoſe, who in trivial Matters cannot to a Hairs breadth come to what is required, is Perſecution; but not to reſtrain from Blaſphemy and Idolatry, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Fundamentals, the Cauſe makes the difference between what is Perſecution, and what is not; in this, as in other things, names happen to be miſapply'd which ſhould not be; for the Hanging of a Murtherer, which is a due Execution of Juſtice, may not be call'd Cruelty or Injuſtice, neither Puniſhing and Suppreſſing of Blaſphemy, Perſecution.</p>
            <p>But in the Book in queſtion, the Author runs upon many wrong Notions, vain Reaſons, and of dangerous Conſequence for Church and State, that deſerve to be anſwered otherwiſe than with Pen and Ink, which I leave for thoſe to do that are more concern'd than I, there being ſome words and things in't which I think, he deſerves to be made to eat up: As to the Topicks of their Policy about Magiſtrates, I ſhall not meddle with, for all the many flaws therein, only ſome few things relating to Religion, I will take notice of, as firſt, he denyeth the neceſſity of a Judge in Religious as 'tis in Civil Matters, which he calls Ridiculous, as well as Unjuſt, yet in <hi>page</hi> 19. he affirms,<note place="margin">pag. 20. 21, 22.</note> in Matters meerly Religious Reaſon to be the Judge; for he ſaith, <hi>there is no other judge on earth but every one's own reaſon.</hi> Which ſometimes may judge of things whether true or falſe, good or evil, but which Reaſon? not Natural, but Supernaturally endowed, and how? not of its ſelf and own Authority, but only according to the Rule which God hath given in his Word; thus when our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon takes upon her ſelf to Judge of Religious Things, it may no more depart from the Rule and Authority
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:30142:95"/>of Scripture, then a Judge upon the Bench from the Law; therefore, when any ſuch thing is attributed to Reaſon, it ought to be underſtood of Reaſon guided by Scripture: We agree, that God hath reſerved Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion for his own Tribunal to a final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the laſt Day; ſo he hath Civil ones too; yet this doth not hinder, but that in the mean while, the Magiſtrate may decide Civil Matters, and puniſh Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours; ſo he muſt for thoſe about Religion, the puniſhment here, relates to the preſent time, but that of God ſhall be for Eternity: Therein the Magiſtrate doth not, as he would have it, invade God's Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which his is Subordinate unto, and from which, there is an Appeal, and then there ſhall be the Deciſive and Final Judgment, God being the Supreme Judge of all, by whom ſhall many Sentences be Reverſed; the Judgment which he ſpeaks of, is about Indifferent and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial things, as are Meat, and keeping of ſome Days, of a very different Nature,<note place="margin">pag. <hi>75.</hi>

What Times are we come to, that ſuch things are ſuffered to be Printed, and go unpuniſh'd? The Magiſtrate may not puniſh thoſe who diſhonour the true God, when they ought to puniſh thoſe who diſhonour falſe Gods: Thus <hi>Papiſts</hi> do well to puniſh thoſe who deſpiſe their Wafer-God, but thoſe who deſpiſe and blaſpheme the true Son of God, the Lord Jeſus, muſt not be meddled with: Theſe abominable Lines of Idolatrous Theology, I read a ſecond, nay, a third time, thinking I had been miſtaken at the firſt reading.</p>

            <p>But to turn to the Text, the Author ſaith, we ought to prove two things;<note place="margin">pag. <hi>69.</hi>
               </note> firſt, <hi>That meer Errours of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding are evil-Works,</hi> which, by the Grace of God, I hope to do, but knowing their Cavilling Humour, we muſt clear the way before us; The Underſtanding being the Spring and proper Seat of Theorical Errours, it had been fit for him to have ſaid what he meaneth by the word <hi>meer,</hi> whether a <hi>tranſient</hi> falſe Speculation, or an <hi>immanent,</hi> ſuch a one as goes no farther, but ſtops there in the Mind: This laſt doth affect only the Party, and it making ſometimes but a ſlight Impreſſion, is in time forgotten; but the firſt produceth ill Effects, for it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into the Heart, where it ſettles, and thence breaks out. Now I ſay, that theſe meer Errours of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are evil Works: The Underſtanding is the Judgment-Seat of the Soul, where whatſoever comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, is examined, and there Judgment paſſed whether it be true or falſe: And as the Will follows the laſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of the Intellect, ſo thence it paſſes into the Will, and is either received as good, or rejected as evil, when the firſt, as commonly 'tis, then the Affections, ſeated in the Heart or Will, are engaged: When we ſay the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Underſtanding are evil Works, by Works we do not mean what is generally oppoſed to Thoughts, for all Man's Actions are diſtinguiſhed into Thoughts, Words, and Deeds or Works; now the Underſtanding hath its Works and Operations, as well as the other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul, or Members of the Body, but in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner, and of a different Nature; to repreſent this, we uſe to ſay, that Man hath a working Head, and his Brains are at work: In this ſenſe we ſay that Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Underſtanding are evil Works; ſuch is the black Liſt by our Saviour ſpoken of,<note place="margin">Mark 7.21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>Out of the heart of men proceed evil Thoughts, Adulteries, Fornications, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Thefts, Covetouſneſs, Wickedneſs, Blaſphemy,</hi> &amp;c. all theſe are evil Works, and all come <hi>from within,</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> which is the great thing in queſtion, is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and <hi>Hereſie,</hi> another great Evil, which we juſtly charge <hi>Socinians</hi> with,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.20.</note> is reckoned among <hi>the Works of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:30142:99"/>the Fleſh.</hi> Such workings are in Mind and Heart, <hi>In heart ye work wickedneſs,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 58.2.</note> Theſe are evil Works, puniſhable by the Magiſtrate, according to the Text of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which we now are upon, and both Blaſphemy and Hereſie are certainly Matters of Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which to puniſh, as alſo Idolatry, doth bind the Chriſtian as it did the Jewiſh Magiſtrate, and he is as much obliged to execute Juſtice upon, as againſt Adulteries, Fornications, Murthers, Thefts, and other Wickedneſſes already mention'd: Now to cloſe up this Head, I ſay, that as meer Errours in the Underſtanding are evil Works, it neceſſarily follows, that thoſe who be guilty thereof, are Evil-doers; all we can do for thoſe who will deny this, is in the words of the <hi>Roman</hi> Poet, to wiſh them, <hi>mentem ſanam in corpore ſano,</hi> a ſound Mind in a ſound Body.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> thing he would have us to prove is this, that the Apoſtle means ſuch here, that is, as hold Fundamental Errors, and are guilty of Blaſphemy, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and Idolatry, (elſe it were not to the purpoſe, for theſe are the things in queſtion,) and do own, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and practiſe it; for elſe no Man being a ſearcher of the Heart and Mind, knows what paſſes therein, and ſo may not Puniſh, but for what comes within his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge, therefore there ought to be Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Proofs drawn out of Overt Acts, as Words, Diſcourſes, Writings, and the like; the Apoſtle ſaying here, that the Ruler is a Miniſter of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth Evil, and not adding <hi>in Civil Matters,</hi> which had been neceſſary, if he intended to have reſtrained it only to ſuch, or elſe he had not ſufficiently expreſſed his Mind; but ſeeing he ſimply ſaith, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon him that doth Evil;</hi> Can any thing forbid us to believe, and affirm, he meant doing Evil in things pertaining to God, as well as to Men? And is it not an abominable thing for them to exclude things of Religion, and to make Limitations where God hath made none? Therefore, if God hath appointed the Magiſtrate to puniſh all that do Evil, (for the word <hi>him</hi> being indefinite, doth generally comprehend all that do ſo) and hath not ſaid againſt his Neighbour, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Publick Good, why ſhould we not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:30142:100"/>it in any kind that deſerves Puniſhment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, in Religious Matters, as well as thoſe of the Civil Society? What he ſaith, that this relates only to Civil Matters, becauſe of theſe words, <hi>Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power, do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame;</hi> is not to the purpoſe, as it will appear ſomewhat lower? We are not ſo ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as they, to limitate it only to Matters of Religion, and not alſo extend it to thoſe of a Civil Nature, for we own it relates to both Temporal and Spiritual things.</p>
            <p>Here the Apoſtle from <hi>verſe</hi> 1, to 7. incluſively, upon three Motives exhorted to Obey the Superiour Powers, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Hope of Reward, <hi>Second,</hi> Fear of Puniſhment, and <hi>Third,</hi> for Conſcience ſake, in caſe the other two could not prevail; and though he doth not ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mention the Duty of Rulers, yet he inſinuates how they ought to Reward Good Works, and Puniſh Evil ones: Now to Command, and to Obey, are two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives, and if Actively or Paſſively, we muſt Obey in all Juſt and Lawful things, as are not againſt, but for the Honour and Glory of God, as are all of a truely Religious Nature, then the Magiſtrate may command all that are ſuch, and by Penalties compel Men to Obey in things relating to Religion, as well as to Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; and if he may make Laws to force Men to be Juſt one to another, much more hath God Authoriz'd him by Law to force them to give God his due, and not rob him of his own, as more immediately, and in a ſpecial manner are things belonging to Religion; for in the Text, Obedience is commanded to be yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of a Principle of Conſcience, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. and for fear of Damnation, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. both which, certainly relate to Religion. When God gave <hi>Moſes</hi> the Decalogue, he divided it into two Tables, whereof the firſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related to him, as being Matters of Religion, as the ſecond did to the Civil Society; and were not the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the firſt Table puniſhed as thoſe of the ſecond? Or is it reaſonable to think, that God took care of Man's Concern, and wholly neglected his own; ſo that in this World they might offend him and go unpuniſhed? what kind of Encouragement would this have been to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:30142:100"/>all manner of Impiety, Prophaneneſs, and Spiritual Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs? No Humane Law doth <hi>per ſe,</hi> and of it ſelf bind the Conſcience, only in as much as 'tis grounded upon God's own, who is the only Judge of it; and can Men imagine that any Wiſe Law-giver will make Laws to maintain every Man's Right and Property, and not in the leaſt mind his own? Therefore we muſt ſay, that God hath given the Magiſtrate Power, though not to Exerciſe any Office in Holy things, as without a ſpecial Call to Preach the Word, and Adminiſter the Sacraments, yet to defend, maintain, and be a Nurſing Father to the Church, which is God's Houſe.</p>
            <p>They would take advantage of this, that when the Epiſtle was written to the Chriſtian Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> they were under the Dominion of Infidels, who would not commend or enconrage them in matters of their Religion, ſeeing they were not for, but againſt it: Let it be ſo, yet tho' they would not own the Cauſe, the Effects they ſometimes would praiſe and commend, as Humility, Self-denial, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Sobriety, Temperance, Gentleneſs, and ſuch Effects of a Chriſtian Frame and Spirit: The very Enemies of Chriſt ſometimes admired to ſee thoſe Graces, which are the Fruits of Faith, and of Chriſtian Religion; therefore, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Be ye holy in all manner of converſation;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.15.</note> and this is not only for the diſcharge of their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but alſo in Relation to the Infidels, and for the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of Chriſtian Profeſſion,<note place="margin">Chap. 2.12, 15.</note> for he adds, <hi>Having your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation honeſt among the Gentiles, that whereas they ſpeak againſt you as Evil doers, they may by your good works which they ſhall behold, glorifie God in the day of Viſitation.</hi> And becauſe of a Prejudice which Chriſt's Enemies had againſt Religion, and thoſe who profeſs'd it, which made them ſpeak ill of both, he ſaith, <hi>For ſo is the will of God, that with well doing, ye may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh Men.</hi> This the Apoſtle learned of his and our great Lord and Maſter, who had ſaid: <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before Men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 5.16.</note> 
               <hi>that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven.</hi> So the Good Works of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians might have praiſe from Chriſt's Enemies and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels; ſuch were the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours. Beſides that, St. <hi>Paul</hi> did intend thoſe Rules, not only for the preſent, when he wrote to the <hi>Romans,</hi> but alſo for after times,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:30142:101"/>for all thoſe things were written for our Inſtruction and of others, to the Worlds end; it related alſo to Chriſtian Emperours, Kings and other Magiſtrates in after Ages. who according to God's Promiſe, were to be Nurſing Fathers to the Church, and Defenders of the Faith. Now this I ſay, that as in the Text is a generality of Perſons exhorted to be ſubject to ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Powers; for 'tis ſaid, <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject;</hi> and the Apoſtle ſpeaking in the Singular, <hi>Wilt thou,</hi> Ver. 3. and <hi>if thou do,</hi> Ver 4. meaneth every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Perſon in the World; So there is an Univerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the things committed unto the Magiſtrates Care, which are reduced under theſe two Heads, Religious and Secular; <hi>Species</hi> are contain'd under the <hi>Genus,</hi> and Particulars, as ſaid before, under Generals: When we pray for our Daily Bread, therein Meat, Drink, Cloathes, and other Neceſſaries for Life are included.</p>
            <p>Now I am to take notice of his Anſwer to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Text,<note place="margin">Job. 31.28.</note> 
               <hi>This alſo were an iniquity to be puniſh'd by the Judge;</hi> Speaking of <hi>Idolatry:</hi> Here he thinks he hath a great advantage, for the words, <hi>to be puniſhed by the,</hi> are not in the Original, and hereupon, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds himſelf thus, <hi>It's an eaſie thing to have proofs, if Men when they cannot find them are reſolved to make them:</hi> To make Proofs when there are none, and to deny Proofs when there are, is proper for <hi>Socinians,</hi> which we have too many Inſtances of; but to tho thing, 'tis true, thoſe words are not in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> but any that is acquainted with that Tongue knows how ſhort and Conciſe it is, that's the Idiome of it, which he nor I cannot change, but to make it Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in other Languages, ſomething ought to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; in the Original 'tis thus, <hi>This alſo an iniquity the Judge:</hi> Which in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and every other modern Language is very lame; there is no Verb Subſtantive, <hi>is</hi> or <hi>were</hi> an Iniquity, which any one may ſee ought to be underſtood: Now, I ſay, that what is inſerted, is no Addition to the Original, with an intent to impoſe upon the Reader, for 'tis Printed in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Letter, but only to make it Senſe in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> without which it hath none, or at leaſt a very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect one.

To explain the thing, out of ſeveral places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture appears the neceſſity of ſupplying ſome words in our Tranſlations to make up the Senſe; <hi>Three</hi> only I ſhall mention: The <hi>firſt</hi> is out of <hi>Amos,</hi> 'tis ſaid,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>chap.</hi> 1.3, 6, 9, 11, 13.</note> 
               <hi>For three tranſgreſſions of Damaſcus, and for four, I will not turn away the puniſhment thereof.</hi> The word <hi>Puniſhment</hi> is not in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which in <hi>Engliſh</hi> makes certainly the Senſe imperfect, Turn away what? the Puniſhment <hi>thereof,</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> ſo that the word Puniſhment muſt be added to make up the Senſe, and that in <hi>ſeven</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Verſes of the ſame Chapter. The other <hi>two</hi> are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> whereof the <hi>firſt</hi> in the Original is this, <hi>Let their table become a ſnare befor them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 69.22.</note> 
               <hi>and for welfare a trap;</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> the Senſe is lame in the latter part of the Verſe, therefore 'twas neceſſary thus to ſupply it, and <hi>that which ſhould have been</hi> for <hi>their</hi>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:30142:102"/>Welfare, <hi>let it become</hi> a Trap. The <hi>other</hi> Text is this, <hi>For my love they are my adverſaries, but I give my ſelf unto prayer:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 109.4.</note> in the latter part of the Verſe, the words, <hi>give my ſelf unto,</hi> are not in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> only, <hi>but I prayer,</hi> which is no ſenſe in <hi>Engliſh: David</hi> is not Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor an Iniquity the Judge, therefore it ſhould be ſupplied, which the Tranſlatours have well done. Now to be even with this Author, theſe two things I leave for him to prove; <hi>firſt,</hi> That this is not the Idiom of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language; the <hi>ſecond,</hi> That the Words ſupplied to make out the Senſe in theſe places, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Analogy of Faith, or the Scope of God's Spirit therein, and I give him a long time to conſider upon't.</p>
            <p>But enough of this: As to their politick Reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Magiſtrate's Authority in point of Religion, and for a general Naturalization, whereby they at once would blow up an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Birth-Right, with the Seven Years Apprentiſhip, and bring in all Foreigners, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade unto themſelves, and ſow the pernicious Tares of Hereſie, Blaſphemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> among us with more liberty, for they are alſo for a general Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in all theſe, I ſay, their Policy is no better than their Divinity, as might eaſily be demonſtrated: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to Tolerate ſome Opinions about indifferent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial Things, can contribute towards Peace and Union, do much Good and no Harm; but 'twould be very pernicious concerning Fundamental Errours. God, Chriſt, and Religion muſt not be ſacrificed to Intereſt, and other Worldly Conſiderations. Yet if <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Mahommetans</hi> would not diſturb the Government, they would be content to bring them in, as already we have the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> (whoſe Converſion I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly pray for) whom upon the account of Trade, and of ſomething elſe, they are ſo fond of, that a great Care muſt be had to give them no Diſtaſte, for fear they would be gone, when they are as glad to ſtay here, as ſome ſeem afraid leſt they ſhould go, as if here they were the Pillars of Trade, but ſome think there is cauſe to believe the contrary: I can remember how in <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s time, they ſent over <hi>Manaſſeh Ben-Iſrael,</hi> to get leave to come and ſettle here, he offered
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:30142:102"/>200000 <hi>l,</hi> whereupon <hi>Cromwell</hi> call'd ſome Divines for Advice, Whether, in Conſcience, he might Receive and Tolerate thoſe that diſown, and are profeſſed Enemies to Chriſt? They anſwered, He might; becauſe it might afford ſome occaſion for their Converſion: Then he ſent for Lawyers to know (becauſe long before they had been Baniſh'd) whether, according to Law, he might do't? The Anſwer was, He might, as long as he and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who are the Legiſlative Power, were agreed: But laſt of all, he ſummon'd ſome of the chief Merchants, to have their Opinion about it in relation to Trade; but theſe broke the Neck of the Buſineſs, for they repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how that Nation being cunning, would to the prejudice of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by crafty means engroſs Trade wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves, whereupon there was an end: And it muſt be owned, that <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his Counſel underſtood well enough the Nations Intereſt in point of Trade; neither doth it appear, why the ſame Reaſons ſhould not be now, as good as they were at that time, ſince 'tis the ſame Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which ſtill follows the ſame ſteps, as any one may ſee that will take notice of it.</p>
            <p>But enough of theſe Human Conſiderations; I wiſh every Man would ſeriouſly lay Hand upon his Conſcience, and in earneſt mind what account they can give God, (who certainly ſoon or late will call them to't) of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents he hath committed, and of the Authority he hath put into their Hands; what good they have done, and what evil prevented, or puniſh'd, to anſwer the Giver's Ends: I ſay, my Horſe is to carry me, my Oxe to Plough my Ground, and my Dog to watch about my Houſe, or to follow me; all theſe anſwer my Ends, or elſe I put them off; and may not every one elſe, as well as I, reaſonably put this Queſtion to himſelf, For what End hath God brought me into the World? Certainly not to pleaſe my own Fancy, follow my own Humour, or ſatisfie my own Luſt and Paſſion, but in my ſtation to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſerve him, that's the Work, and the <hi>one needful thing.</hi> For ſaith our Saviour,<note place="margin">Luke 10.42. Mat. 6.33.</note> 
               <hi>Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs, and all things ſhall be added unto you.</hi> God is the good Maſter who will take care of our Concerns, if we neglect not his, but do follow the Apoſtle's Rule, to <hi>do all things for the Glory of God,</hi> and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:30142:103"/>of his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. The ſame Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.9.</note> 
               <hi>Neither let us tempt Chriſt as ſome of them</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Wilderneſs <hi>alſo tempted;</hi> ſo I ſay, let none of us tempt Chriſt, as did the <hi>Jews</hi> in his time, who ſtill asked for a Sign, after he had given them ſeveral. Muſt he every Day give them new Signs, and work new Miracles, to prove himſelf to be the true and proper Son of God? That unbelieving Nation, in the higheſt degree tempted him when they ſaid,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.</note> 
               <hi>If he be the Son of God, let him now come down from the Croſs, and we will believe him</hi> to be the Son of God: But he to prove himſelf to be the Son of God, did more and a greater thing than they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; for after Death to raiſe himſelf, as he did out of the Grave, was more than if he had come down from the Croſs when alive: Was not our Bleſſed Redeemer ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently tempted upon Earth by the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he muſt be tempted again, now when he is in Heaven? The <hi>Jews</hi> tempted him in his State of Humiliation, and now <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> do when he is Glorified: The <hi>Jews</hi> would then have had him to come down from the Croſs, and now the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> would have him to come down from Heaven to prove himſelf to be the Son of God; yet againſt them he hath from Heaven provided a Witneſs ſince his Aſcenſion, I mean <hi>Paul,</hi> as we read <hi>Acts</hi> 22.14, 15.</p>
            <p>Before I make an end, I neither can nor muſt forbear to ſay how it affords too much matter of ſad Thoughts in thoſe who are concern'd for the Cauſe and Intereſt of the Eternal Son of God, and of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> to ſee here Hereſie, Blaſphemy and Idolatry as good as Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Unpuniſh'd, and abroad the Profeſſors of the true Chriſtian Religion unjuſtly and cruelly perſecuted. In <hi>France,</hi> againſt all Edicts, Engagements and Promiſes in their Lives, Liberties, and Fortunes, moſt barbarouſly: in the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> the <hi>Vaudois</hi> (which we may well call that Mother Church, which ſtood in no need of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, for it never was ſtain'd with the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) are now againſt all manner of Right and Juſtice, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter great and many Services, ungratefully turn'd out of their own Countrey, where their Fore-fathers with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom enjoy'd their Spiritual and Civil Liberties, before there were in the World any ſuch thing as a Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> or a Prince of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> in <hi>Bohemia, Sileſia, Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:30142:103"/>Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> both treacherouſly and violently deprived of Rights and Liberties: In <hi>Germany,</hi> by a late Treaty, conſiderable <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Members are out off from the Empire, brought under <hi>Popery,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored ſtrong Places along the <hi>Rhine,</hi> inſtead of being made a Compenſation for what <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have loſt in thoſe parts, do but paſs out of one <hi>Popiſh</hi> Hand into another, which is not better; And the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabruck,</hi> which as a <hi>Preliminary</hi> was agreed upon, to be the Ground of that part of the laſt which related to <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> is thereby broken in that point which concern'd Religion, to the great prejudice of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cauſe within the Empire, as there is a ſad Experience of it in the unjuſt Innovations ſince made in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, which therein may happen to prove the Ground of Trouble and Confuſion about it. And yet one of the <hi>Northern</hi> Crowns, much concerned in the full obſervation of the Peace of <hi>Munſter,</hi> without any regard to Matters of Religion within the Empire, as they were ſettled by that Treaty, hath newly made a Defenſive League for keeping this poſteriour Treaty, tho' it much derogates from the former, and all this gives but a bad preſent proſpect of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cauſe in <hi>Europe,</hi> which in Man's Eye doth much decay, and it Makes good the Apoſtle's Saying,<note place="margin">Philip. 2.21. Amos 6.6.</note> 
               <hi>All ſeek their own, not the things which are Jeſus Chriſt's:</hi> But God pronounces a <hi>Woe</hi> againſt thoſe <hi>that are not grieved for the Affliction of Joſeph,</hi> and afford not their helping Hand.</p>
            <p>But this is enough ſpoken to and of Men, whoſe help is often deceitful and vain, ſo I turn to God, who never failed thoſe that ſeek him in Faith, and with an awful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. <hi>O Lord,</hi> more or leſs, we all are wanting in our Duty towards thee: Some want Occaſions, others want a Heart to improve them when offered; ſome want Power and Abilities, when others want a willing Mind; nay, whilſt a ſmall number are real and ſincere, tho' not ſtrong enough to do things as they ought to be; others are full of Gall and Bitterneſs againſt thy Honour and Concerns, and ſome others very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, look on, and are to chuſe their Religion; yet all this while thou haſt been a Long-ſuffering and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent God, thereby inviting Men to Repentance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:30142:104"/>time to forſake their Errours, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Truth. Even that which is offered unto, and for thee, is <hi>Lame and Blind,</hi> narrow in it ſelf; but when it pleaſeth thee, thou canſt enlarge it. Rewards and Puniſhments thou haſt in ſtore for every Man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Works: <hi>What then ſhall we ſay to theſe things?</hi> Be thou pleaſed to guide, ſtrengthen, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper thy Servants, Convert or Confound thine Enemies; and whoſoever obſtinately refuſeth to ſubmit to Chriſt's Golden Scepter, which is ſo graciouſly tendered, Let them <hi>with the Rod of Iron be broken in pieces like a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Veſſel,</hi> Pſal. 2.8, 9. And notwithſtanding the Rage, Malice, and Craftineſs of Devils and Men, let his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt be the prevailing one in the World; and as his Service is in it ſelf Honourable and Profitable, ſo let it be to all that engage in't:<note place="margin">Pſ. 57.11.</note> And <hi>be thou exalted, O God, above the Heavens, let thy Glory be above all the Earth.</hi>
